1	None:None	It seems that medical responders (even hospital staff, actually) and other emergency services do more good for society than soldiers
2	None:None	such discounts should be given to them.

13	2:undercutter	There are plenty of professions that do great things for society
16	15:rebuttal_attack	I don't believe I ever argued that they were.
