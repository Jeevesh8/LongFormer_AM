title	None:None	CMV: Swimming is the best form of exercise
0	title:partial_disagreement	obviously a balanced exercise regimen is the best choice for health and well-being
2	title:agreement	there is no reason other than lack of availability to choose anything other than swimming
7	title:disagreement	"best form of exercise" is actually meaningless
12	2:undercutter	you are dismissing "lack of availability" as a reason pretty easily.
13	12:support	That is probably one of the biggest reasons.
14	13:partial_agreement	fair enough
15	13:partial_attack	I still feel that for those who are able swimming is the best form of exercise
