2	1:support	One reason I take this stance is because the newly released games are ectremely similar to their predecessors.
3	2:support	There are few if any changes in gameplay, and the basic level design for the most part, remains the same.
4	2:support	Even Advanced Warfare, which seemed to promise the most novel changes, was criticized for changing too little from its preceding games.
5	1:support	Another reason for my opinion is that CoD doesn't really have anything astoundingly different from other games of the same genre.
6	5:support	There are a few unique features here and there, but overall, it's just another FPS with nothing spectacular that sets it above the other games in its genre.
