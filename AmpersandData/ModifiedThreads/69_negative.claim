title	None:None	CMV: EMTs, SAR, firefighters, police, etc. should receive “military discounts”.
1	None:None	It seems that medical responders (even hospital staff, actually) and other emergency services do more good for society than soldiers
2	None:None	such discounts should be given to them.
7	1:partial_agreement	EMS people are just as deserving of these discounts (and that many more people contribute enough to be placed in the same category),
8	1:partial_attack	these discounts shouldn’t be offered at all.]
8a	1:undercutter	Sure firefighters, EMT's, and nurses do great things for people. . . for those who have money and great insurance.
8b	1:undercutter	What a douchebag line.
9	8a:rebuttal_attack	It's not like the dispatcher chooses which calls to answer based on insurance policies.
