CMV: EMTs, SAR, firefighters, police, etc. should receive “military discounts”.
[USER0] 
For those of you who don’t know, it’s common (at least in the US) for businesses, transit agencies, etc. to give small discounts to military veterans to thank them for their service.
It seems that medical responders (even hospital staff, actually) and other emergency services do more good for society than soldiers  and that  such discounts should be given to them.
As for the “They’re not risking their lives for our country.” argument, police officers do that too, and for citizens rather than the country and its interests.
Some might argue that soldiers do the US a disservice rather than help, but that’s [usually] the fault of their leaders and therefore not relevant to the debate. 

I’m really hoping there’s a good reason behind the status quo, but we’ll see.
 [It looks like there’s even less reason behind it than I initially thought, actually.]

[[My view’s been changed.]([URL]) In summary, I think that  EMS people are just as deserving of these discounts (and that many more people contribute enough to be placed in the same category),  but I now believe - for the same reason - that  these discounts shouldn’t be offered at all.]

Sure firefighters, EMT's, and nurses do great things for people. . . for those who have money and great insurance.
What a douchebag line.

 It's not like the dispatcher chooses which calls to answer based on insurance policies.

You’ll have fun [here]([URL]), then.
