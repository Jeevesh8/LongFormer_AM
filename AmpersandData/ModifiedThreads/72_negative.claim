title	None:None	CMV: EMTs, SAR, firefighters, police, etc. should receive “military discounts”.
1	None:None	It seems that medical responders (even hospital staff, actually) and other emergency services do more good for society than soldiers
2	None:None	such discounts should be given to them
7	1:partial_agreement	EMS people are just as deserving of these discounts (and that many more people contribute enough to be placed in the same category)
8	1:partial_attack	these discounts shouldn’t be offered at all
9	1:undercutter	I'd like to point out federal vs. municipal difference when it comes to location of the discount.
17	1:rebuttal_attack	may point to a succinct reason why they tend to receive a blanket discount in most areas of the US.
18	9:partial_agreement	That’s a good point
