title	None:None	CMV: I believe you have three choices once you discover the suffering animals endure in the meat industry...
0	None:None	The options are as follows
1	None:None	1. You don't agree with what is going on and stop supporting it.
2	None:None	2. You don't care about animals, so you're content with paying for them to be abused for your pleasure.
3	None:None	3. You don't agree with what is going on, but try to put it to the back of your mind and continue to support it.
5	None:None	I suspect this way of looking at it is still somewhat simplistic however
11	0:undercutter	If I stop eating meat today, it won't make any difference whatsoever and won't save even a single animal's life.
12	1:rebuttal_attack	The only way to make real change in industries like this is to organize and participate in a boycott on a wide-scale level
13	1:rebuttal_attack	to petition the government to make regulation changes.
