title	None:None	CMV: Otherkin are delusional and should be treated as such
2	title:agreement	Otherkin, or animalkin, the belief that their soul is an animal or something nonhuman, fit this definition
3	title:disagreement	should be urged to seek psychiatric evaluation rather than joining communities of similar "kin."
7	title:agreement	We should not encourage and accept otherkin behavior, but rather encourage seeking treatment for a delusional disorder.
10	0:rebuttal	Generally speaking, delusions themselves are arguably less relevant to whether or not a behavior is indicative of a disorder than are the social repercussions of that behavior.
17	title:undercutter	While you may find the practice disingenuous or disgusting, this is not reason enough to hold the behavior as evidence of a specific disorder in and of itself
18	title:undercutter	in cases where there may be genuine mental illness involved, I believe that there's enough criteria already set forth in the DSM to diagnose these conditions accurately without directly addressing this particular cultural phenomenon as some kind of mental health outlier.
19	10:agreement	You're right.
21	10:agreement	if someone is generally in a better state identifying as an otherkin, then there would be no real need to treat them, unless they started disrupting the lives of others.
