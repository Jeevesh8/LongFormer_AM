I am just expressing that I find current islam a religion I mistrust.
I am not saying everyone should mistrust them or that I should change my behaviour in any way, but islam has some toxic components christianity no longer has.

&gt; far morel likely in general to be killed by a Christian than a Muslim

This has nothing to do with the religion but by what we are surrounded by.
I probably am more likely to be killed by a muslim than a christian *because of their religion*. Although the odds have little to do regarding trust or feelings.
