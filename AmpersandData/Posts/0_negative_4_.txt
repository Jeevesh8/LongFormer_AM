 Your surrounded by enough Christians you're still probably more likely to be killed by a Christian for religious reasons than a Muslim.  
It's an issue of rate, and at that point, I'd like to see stats. 
 I'm not going to take an emotional appeal when considering whether or not a religion has dangerous components. 

What particular aspects do you find toxic?
