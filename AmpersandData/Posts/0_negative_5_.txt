&gt; Your surrounded by enough Christians you're still probably more likely to be killed by a Christian for religious reasons than a Muslim

That is due to statistics, not to scripture or religious property.
you are more likely to be killed by a heart attack than by a christian, this doesn't say anything about christianity.

&gt; I'm not going to take an emotional appeal when considering whether or not a religion has dangerous components.

Emotional?
I am just looking at the outcome of people following the religion.
Facts.

&gt; What particular aspects do you find toxic?

The fanatism and radical actions it allows and encourages.
Do you want quran quotes or something?
