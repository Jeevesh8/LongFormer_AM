I point out that many Christians follow the bible which has numerous examples of sexism, but in application, there are numerous branches of Christianity that are no more sexist than secular groups.
my belief is that while religion can inform the views of people, it is far more likely that religion will be used to justify actions that would have been executed any way.
I think that most Jewish people don't want to stone adulterers and most Muslims don't want to stone non believers.
