 Your stance relies on the assumption that religion has no influence on the actions of its followers beyond the superficial.  
 Yet something must exist that allows this pattern to occur.  
Ill narrow it down to religion or culture. 
So,  you are correct if you assume the culture dominates the religion, and you are incorrect if the reverse is true.  
 With this in mind, I think its safe to assume the truth is somewhere in between, with both the religion and the culture somehow influencing the unrest we see.
