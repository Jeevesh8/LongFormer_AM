 I suppose I was taking a harsh stance when I assumed that religion had no effect on behavior , when  it obviously does . 

 I still think the culture dominates religion to a great extent , however I cannot ignore that religion does have an effect on culture to some extent.

I do however, look forward to seeing if someone can convince me that culture is dominated by religion more than vise versa.
