Not getting the money is not an option
You're carrying and you rear end a guy.
When do you reach for your holster to draw your weapon and when do you fire it?
You're carrying
you just picked up your brand new car from the dealer
while you were at the stoplight some asshole that was obviously texting while driving rear ends you in your brand new car
The only reason this stuff doesn't happen all the time is because we can make the reasonable assumption that a person we are having a conflict with is unarmed.
