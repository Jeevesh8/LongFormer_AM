I don't think this decision changes if you are comfortable killing for money
When he starts to pulling out a gun you try to get cover
when he starts aiming at you you draw to fire
you are in right to defend yourself
If you are unsure of someone's intentions you should get cover
as soon he notices that and doesn't intend to kill you he should make this well known to you
