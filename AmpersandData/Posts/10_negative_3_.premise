This isn't the movies where you duck bullets and dive behind a table or something.
By the time they have their hand on their gun you have maybe 2 seconds
by the time they start aiming it at you, you have a fraction of one.
There is a reason why police, when they have reason to believe that someone is armed have their guns already drawn.
That shit happens fast, and reactive speed isn't fast enough.
