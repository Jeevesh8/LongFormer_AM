You'd likely be dead in scenarios 2 and 3.
This isn't the movies where you duck bullets and dive behind a table or something.
By the time they have their hand on their gun you have maybe 2 seconds, and by the time they start aiming it at you, you have a fraction of one.
There is a reason why police, when they have reason to believe that someone is armed have their guns already drawn.
That shit happens fast, and reactive speed isn't fast enough.

As for scenario 1, once you remove the non-lethal option, the lethal one gets a lot more comfortable.
