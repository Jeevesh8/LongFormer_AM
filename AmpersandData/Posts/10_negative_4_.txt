Yes, but I don't see how you intend to CMV with the scenarios 2 and 3.
I don't see them as very likely as nobody is going to draw a concealed gun when not intending to kill.

With scenario 1 I would expect the effect would be that the still thinking criminals would change to some other safer crime as their chances of getting shot would also increase.
It would still be illegal to kill a robber so I don't think some of them would start killing (thus being legal to kill in defense).
