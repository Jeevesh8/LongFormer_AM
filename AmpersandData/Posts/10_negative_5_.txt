Of course you intend to kill the person if you draw your weapon, if you can reasonably assume that they have a weapon, you can't wait for them to draw theirs before you decide to defend yourself if you want to leave alive.
All you know in all three scenarios is that someone you are in conflict with probably has a gun and there is a significant chance they will use it.

If you don't have reasonable cause to believe someone is armed because very few people have CCWs then things like letting the guy you just rear ended blow off steam becomes a reasonable option because he likely can't kill you within in a few seconds.

If 1 in 5 people can kill you in seconds being impolite gets deadly very quickly.
