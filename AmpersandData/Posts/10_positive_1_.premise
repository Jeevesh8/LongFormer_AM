Think of something you do every day that you consider perfectly reasonable; something that harms nobody in any direct sense.
Let's imagine this thing is to defined as "walking down the street wearing headphones".
Now imagine that I tell you that you doing this offends me deeply for reasons of personal belief that you don't share.
I warn you that continuing to do this will mean that I will shoot you on sight.
That does not make my demand legitimate, does not make my shooting you an acceptable act
does not make my actions your fault
I think it's counterproductive, antagonizing and in poor taste.
if someone disagrees with me on that point, *they don't deserve to be shot.*
