&gt; Perhaps this is a bad analogy - but if you say something antagonizing to a bully and you get your ass kicked, you should have anticipated that outcome.

Think of something you do every day that you consider perfectly reasonable; something that harms nobody in any direct sense.
Let's imagine this thing is to defined as "walking down the street wearing headphones".
Now imagine that I tell you that you doing this offends me deeply for reasons of personal belief that you don't share.
I warn you that continuing to do this will mean that I will shoot you on sight.

In a society that can't protect you from me, it might be *wise* for you to take off your headphones to preserve your life.
That does not make my demand legitimate, does not make my shooting you an acceptable act and does not make my actions your fault.
What you ought to hope is that society will protect you from someone like me and make it clear to me that my preferences will not be especially entertained because I threaten violence.

I think people who satirize Muhammad in ways that Muslims consider blasphemous should stop doing that.
I think it's counterproductive, antagonizing and in poor taste.
But if someone disagrees with me on that point, *they don't deserve to be shot.*
