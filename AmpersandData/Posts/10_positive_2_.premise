What would the reaction from Americans be if someone walked through the streets of a predominantly black neighborhood saying "I hate black people" and was murdered?
I guarantee no one would care.
suddenly everyone was up in arms when they thought they were never going to see the movie The Interview because for a few moments Sony reevaluated the situation and decided not to release it.
Nobody seemed to be saying "Jeez guys, maybe this is a really bad idea and we shouldn't do it."
We'll watch our fucking movie cause we'ere FREE in America!!"
