&gt; What would the reaction from Americans be if someone walked through the streets of a predominantly black neighborhood saying "I hate black people" and was murdered?

"What would the likely reaction be?" is not the right question to ask. You should ask "what is the proper reaction?" A person doing that is probably an asshole, but that does not mean that silencing him is a proper reaction.
And I think many people would care, because nothing you say should be enough to justify my shooting you.

The two examples you've mentioned are both examples of satire that have been forcibly silenced.
Satire is the portion of speech that always stretches the boundaries of what we condone because its purpose is often to be offensive as a means of highlighting truths about people or society that are difficult to address seriously.

In any case, I think you may have missed the point.
None of the examples you given actually hurt anybody.
They have only provoked reactions.
North Korea hacked Sony because they are so paranoid and insecure that they can't stand their leader being mocked.
Some Muslims are so irrationally offended and self-important that they believe they have both the imperative and the right to kill people for drawing pictures.
Neither of these examples illustrate problems with the speakers, they show the unhinged reactions of listeners.
