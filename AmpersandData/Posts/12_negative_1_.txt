How so?

One of the person present was under the protection of something called "service de protection des hautes personalit&#233;s" (it has been renamed since but still same goal).
That mean that there was a policemen armed and trained specifically to protect someone in danger of being targeted.

It sadly didn't do them much good.
Unless you bring the same kind of weapons and protections as them it's akin to bringing a knife to a gun fight.
Charb, one of the victim, said concerning the threats he previously received "je pr&#233;f&#232;re mourir debout que vivre &#224; genoux" (I prefer to die rather than live on my knee) and I mostly rejoin it concerning the argument you are making, the cost of constantly living in fear and packing enough fire power to fight this kind of things (you would need to be incredibly level headed, trained and lucky to do it simply with a hand gun) simply isn't worth it.
