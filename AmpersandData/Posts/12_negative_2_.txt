Well we have many examples in history when it was common to walk around well armed, where those doing it were upheld as protectors.
I think with such people among us the public would have less of a reason to be afraid then when the only people defending them is incompetent and untrustworthy police and in many countries you cannot choose to arm yourself appropriately to defend yourself and others.
