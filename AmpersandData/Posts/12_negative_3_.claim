It's definitely not a time I want back
our supposedly incompetent and untrustworthy police are definitely a better job of enforcing the law than those protectors could ever have
I would have to worry about all those morons that can't be trusted with anything and about all the rest that maybe just had one of those days and simply forgot to do what they did 10 000 times before
