&gt; Well we have many examples in history when it was common to walk around well armed, where those doing it were upheld as protectors.

As protectors unless they were the one people needed protection from.
Crimes rates, and especially violent crimes, were also much much higher than they are today in all of those examples.
It's not like it was an utopia where zoro or lucky luck came to solve everything with their weapon before the bad guys had a chance to do something wrong.
It's definitely not a time I want back and our supposedly incompetent and untrustworthy police are definitely a better job of enforcing the law than those protectors could ever have.

&gt; I think with such people among us the public would have less of a reason to be afraid then

You mean if everyone around me has a gun I have less to worry about?
When I see how most people are driving I have absolutely no reason to believe people would be any more capable, responsible or safer with a gun so I would have to worry about all those morons that can't be trusted with anything and about all the rest that maybe just had one of those days and simply forgot to do what they did 10 000 times before.

At the same time rather than being afraid of getting mugged I will be afraid of getting mugged by someone pointing a gun right at my face, someone I have no reason to trust won't shot me by accident.
