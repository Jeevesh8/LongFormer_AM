Intelligence is hard to define and describe even by neurologists
reducing that complexity down to one number is incredibly challenging if not impossible
More intelligent people tend to have less children than do the more uneducated.
There are multiple reasons for this, more intelligent people tend to be more busy with careers, etc.
This means that even if we went really extreme and killed everyone with an IQ under 80.....that would change nothing.
The average IQ will still be measured in the same way
the lowest scores will be assigned the lower numbers and the average will be the same
