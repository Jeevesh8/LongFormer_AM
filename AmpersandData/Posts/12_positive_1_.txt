Firstly, IQ is not considered to be a good or accurate measure of overall intellect.
Intelligence is hard to define and describe even by neurologists and reducing that complexity down to one number is incredibly challenging if not impossible.

It may also be important to note that your system isn't only difficult to implement like you point out, it's also in direct conflict with how things actually work.
More intelligent people tend to have less children than do the more uneducated.
There are multiple reasons for this, more intelligent people tend to be more busy with careers, etc.

Lastly you must recognize that the IQ test is a standardized test.
This means that even if we went really extreme and killed everyone with an IQ under 80.....that would change nothing.
The average IQ will still be measured in the same way, the lowest scores will be assigned the lower numbers and the average will be the same.
