I'm not proposing we implement it
I completely understand your distaste with the IQ test.
And when the IQ test is adjusted, we would adjust the cutoff rate for "da murder" if we were to take that route in the first place.
I don't see your point there
My route would be a slower, more ethical way to do it.
