Firstly, I mentioned that.
("for want of better measure of intelligence")
I would love a better measure of intelligence.
[Some theorize that intelligence can be defined in categories, too...(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_multiple_intelligences) 
So, maybe a complex way to combine them.
Like a total of all of them.
Idc.

I know about number two...
I'm not proposing we implement it.
In a perfect world, sure.
But at least my theory limits the offspring of less-intelligent people.
Less intelligent- less babies than contributors- less "less intelligent people" (and that would always be the case...)

I completely understand your distaste with the IQ test.
Again, I only used the IQ test in my example because so far it is (seemingly) the most available measure of intelligence.
(better than SAT scores, right?)

And when the IQ test is adjusted, we would adjust the cutoff rate for "da murder" if we were to take that route in the first place.
(instead of killing lower than 80, it would be killing lower than like 50 or whatever)
The "number of mental retardation" would be adjusted from lower than 70 to whatever it would be, too, so I don't see your point there.
In total, everyone's IQ would be x points higher and so the human race would be x much smarter...
My route would be a slower, more ethical way to do it.
