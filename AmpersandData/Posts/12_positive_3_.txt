Separating intelligence into categories *is* a far better way to go about it, but by it's very nature implies you cannot sum them.
A brilliant mathematician make suck in all other areas such as music ability, linguistic skills, etc. making them look like a retard compared to a guy who is okay at math but also descent in those other categories.
The point is intelligence is too complicated for us to try to breed certain kinds of it.
It is a complex ploygenic trait we still don't fully understand.
It is also downright silly to consider since, as we know it isn't really feasible to control the populations genitals in any ethical manner.

&gt; I only used the IQ test in my example because so far it is (seemingly) the most available measure of intelligence

This is not a good reason to use anything. I know it sucks but I have nothing better does not justify using a sucky measurement.
