If we valued and weighted the categorical intelligences... Perhaps a brilliant mathematician would end up being (weighted) almost equal to a well rounded guy.
Pass down mathy skills of father and kinesthetic skills of mother or whatever
Eh, maybe we don't fully understand it, but we know that through breeding we can increase it, right?
Just because we don't understand every minute aspect of it doesn't mean we can't recognize what parts are positive and how to increase it.
Well hopefully it wouldn't be implemented in a way that forces you to do anything except stop having children after you reached the point where any more and you'd be hurting future generation's intelligence.
I used it as an example of an intelligence measure
I meant most available as the "most available/recognizable example of intelligence"
