Perhaps, but if we summed it, future generations would be on average smarter than past ones.
If we valued and weighted the categorical intelligences... Perhaps a brilliant mathematician would end up being (weighted) almost equal to a well rounded guy.

I also would like to add, hopefully if we learn more about genetics and genetic engineering we would be able to selectively breed intelligence (Pass down mathy skills of father and kinesthetic skills of mother or whatever)

&gt; (The point is intelligence is too complicated for us to try to breed certain kinds of it. It is a complex ploygenic trait we still don't fully understand.)

Eh, maybe we don't fully understand it, but we know that through breeding we can increase it, right?
Just because we don't understand every minute aspect of it doesn't mean we can't recognize what parts are positive and how to increase it.
Well hopefully it wouldn't be implemented in a way that forces you to do anything except stop having children after you reached the point where any more and you'd be hurting future generation's intelligence.
Let me clarify! You misinterpreted, I wouldn't advocate using the actual IQ scale as the starting measure of doing this at all, I used it as an example of an intelligence measure, and I meant most available as the "most available/recognizable example of intelligence"
I do not want our current IQ scale to be used in any way even close to this.
