Since we do not know the one to one correlations between a complex variety of genes and gene interactions and the vaguely defined intelligence that they produce you cannot feasibly do this.
What if someone with a low intellect (however the hell you measure it) and high intellect want to breed?
Also, only one of my parents finished high school.
I am their 6th child.
I have a Masters degree.
See my user history for reference
We don't know all of the complex genetic and environmental elements that go into intellect to do anything remotely like what you are describing.
The "Yeah but what if..." thing just isn't going to fly.
It is not conducive to a productive conversation of this sort.
