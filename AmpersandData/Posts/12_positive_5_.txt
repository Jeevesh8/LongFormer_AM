I think you are still oversimplifying it.
And no you can't just increase intelligence through controlling the breeding rights of the population.
Since we do not know the one to one correlations between a complex variety of genes and gene interactions and the vaguely defined intelligence that they produce you cannot feasibly do this.
What if someone with a low intellect (however the hell you measure it) and high intellect want to breed?

Also, only one of my parents finished high school.
I am their 6th child.
I have a Masters degree.
(See my user history for reference).
We don't know all of the complex genetic and environmental elements that go into intellect to do anything remotely like what you are describing.

&gt; I also would like to add, hopefully if we learn more about genetics and genetic engineering we would be able to selectively breed intelligence

I, like some of the other commentators here, find the hypothetical game to be intellectually dishonest.
The "Yeah but what if..." thing just isn't going to fly.
It is not conducive to a productive conversation of this sort.
