Well if someone of low intellect wanted to breed with someone of high intellect, their children count would be limited by the lower children count.
Later in life, if higher intellect person wants more children, they can, only if they don't have a genetic contributor from someone who already fulfilled their amount?

I think you could increase intelligence through controlling the breeding rights of a population.
I don't think its feasible, though...

Congrats on your degree, but degrees are no more a measure of intelligence than IQ (which kind of is, meaning degrees kind of are)

We don't know all, true, but we know some, which should be enough to increase intelligence.

Maybe the hypothetical game is annoying and not productive, but its not intellectually dishonest...
I'm sorry, maybe I shouldn't have posted this topic.
I posted with the actual intent of proving that a hypothetical situation could have eugenics be good.

*shrug* in the end, are we agreeing that
1. Eugenics is not realistically feasible
2.
But in a hypothetical world where it is feasible, it would be a good thing
?
