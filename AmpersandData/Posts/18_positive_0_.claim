life is ultimately meaningless and pointless
Death is the great eraser
It makes no difference if I, a 23 year old, die now or live until I am 100 and die
Helping others doesn't matter
then my life is still pointless and meaningless
(2) Attaining fame doesn't matter and doesn't truly make me "immortal."
Enjoying the moment is possible
doesn't make life have a point
