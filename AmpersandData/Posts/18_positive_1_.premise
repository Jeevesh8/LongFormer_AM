If existence (from your perspective) lies solely on your consciousness
it no longer exists since you cannot experience it.
In a metaphysical sense you could argue that we essentially never exist.
death is an elimination of existence
you can free yourself from society's many irrational norms and expectations.
May as well enjoy life while you temporarily exist.
you just never have the conscious mind to experience the fear of contemplating it.
