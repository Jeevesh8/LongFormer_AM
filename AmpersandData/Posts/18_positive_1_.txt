I have contemplated this since I was a young teen and often made me wonder why so many people are concerned with leaving a "legacy". 
If existence (from your perspective) lies solely on your consciousness then after you die it doesn't matter what you left because it no longer exists since you cannot experience it. 
In a metaphysical sense you could argue that we essentially never exist. 
This of course is assuming that death is an elimination of existence which is beyond what anybody truly knows. 
It is a bit depressing but can also be quite liberating as you can free yourself from society's many irrational norms and expectations.

As for things having meaning, from this standpoint you can create your own meaning. 
May as well enjoy life while you temporarily exist.

Your bleak view reminds me of the Queen line from Bohemian Rhapsody, "I don't wanna die. I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all." 
Never being born is essentially the same as being dead, you just never have the conscious mind to experience the fear of contemplating it. 
I guess it comes down to what you think is worse. Never experiencing life or living in fear of death.
