Okay, but even if religion did motivate people to kill, it doesn't provide the means to kill, only the motivation.  
 However, assuming that a gun provides the motivation, it also provides the tool to kill someone with. 

That being said,  I'm not convinced that either motivates people to kill, and one gives the tools to kill with and the other doesn't . 
 This analogy falls short for me.
