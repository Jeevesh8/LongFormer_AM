 Most branches of modern religions aren't inherently violent 
 there are complex socio-political issues involving the ones that are 
 that does not mean that a religion cannot have violence as an integral part of it 
 You are probably right that cultural norms are extremely influential in the creation of a religion 
 once that religion is established as the capital-T Truth, the tail begins wagging the dog and culture shifts to accomodate and protect that Truth. 
 I think in those cases we can both say that the religion is inherently violent 
 that even if culture helped start that norm it eventually becomes the religion that causes the actions. 
 This is exactly the kind of explanation I was looking for. 
 That was terrific.
