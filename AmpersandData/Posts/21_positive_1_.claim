 I think restricting this concept to the meat industry limits us to a "vegetarian/vegan lifestyle vs. carnivore lifestyle" debate 
 it's actually a lot deeper than that. 
 A completely ethical lifestyle is probably not possible without completely rejecting the modern world. 
 I have to accept that I will *never* be able to fully live within my own values.
