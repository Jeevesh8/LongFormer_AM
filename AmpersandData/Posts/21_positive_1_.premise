 I know that there's a good chance that the shirt I'm wearing was produced by underpaid, overworked labors who might have even been children. 
 I know that the salad I'm planning to eat for lunch contains ingredients that were probably farmed in environmentally destructive ways that contribute to climate change. 
 I know that my leftover Christmas cookies, made by my vegetarian mother, still contain eggs that probably came from a battery farm.
