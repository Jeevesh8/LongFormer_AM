 I think restricting this concept to the meat industry limits us to a "vegetarian/vegan lifestyle vs. carnivore lifestyle" debate , when  it's actually a lot deeper than that. 

 I know, for instance, that components in my smartphone and laptop are made of minerals that were mined by slave labor in Africa.  
 I know that the chocolates I love to eat contain, in all likelihood, cacao that was farmed by people living in truly deplorable conditions.  
 I know that the medication I take was almost certainly tested on research animals who lived short, sad lives.  
 I know that there's a good chance that the shirt I'm wearing was produced by underpaid, overworked labors who might have even been children.  
 I know that the salad I'm planning to eat for lunch contains ingredients that were probably farmed in environmentally destructive ways that contribute to climate change.  
 I know that my leftover Christmas cookies, made by my vegetarian mother, still contain eggs that probably came from a battery farm.  
 I know that by purchasing my knockoff Keurig coffee from Wal-Mart, I'm supporting a corporation that exploits everything it touches. 

And that't the ethical weight of just the things that are in arm's reach of me!  
Aren't we all choosing Option 3 for most of the ethical conflicts in our lives?  
I think people quickly reach a point of ethical fatigue where they simply *can't* care anymore. 
 A completely ethical lifestyle is probably not possible without completely rejecting the modern world.   
That doesn't mean I can't try to *reduce* my impact on the world... but  I have to accept that I will *never* be able to fully live within my own values.
