I see what you're getting at.
 It's easier to forget and ignore because there's too much injustice in the world if you tally it all up.  
 I'd still consider what you described as being the third option on my original post , but  it's a very detailed version of it that explains it well. 

&gt;That doesn't mean I can't try to reduce my impact on the world... but I have to accept that I will never be able to fully live within my own values.

 This would also be my reasoning if I were vegan but still wouldn't take a flight out to help build a school in Africa.  
 It would also make sense if I was building a school in African but wasn't vegan. 
 If I was doing absolutely nothing to aid any of the values I believe in, then it wouldn't make any sense however.
