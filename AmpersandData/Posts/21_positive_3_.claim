 Yeah 
 I think there's just a limited number of things that people are capable of caring about at one time 
 issues that are of personal relevance are always going to carry more weight. 
 So somebody who takes Option 3 on a particular issue may not be making a true choice to *ignore* that issue. 
 They're just prioritizing their mental resources.  
 it's good that people have different Option 1 priorities to attack the problems from multiple sides.
