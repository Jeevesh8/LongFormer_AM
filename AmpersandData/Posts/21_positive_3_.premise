 So while someone might take Option 1 on a personally significant issue that has a lot of meaning to them, the limitations of the human mind force them to take Option 3 on a whole lot of other issues. 
 Without prioritizing those resources, there's a risk of "compassion fatigue," 
 which you see frequently among people in empathy-intensive occupations (especially medicine, education, and other fields where issues outside the individual's control tend to produce strong feelings of frustration and futility). 
 I do care about the welfare of food animals 
 I do think that there are ways to produce meat in ways that are at least more humane if not more "ethical." 
 I support these efforts when they're available. 
 But I also think that the welfare of food animals is part of a much larger constellation of interrelated "food production issues" that involve everything from environmental impacts to worker safety to the corporatization of agriculture to government subsidies 
 without some major changes to those other "food production issues" then there probably won't be significant improvement in animal welfare.
