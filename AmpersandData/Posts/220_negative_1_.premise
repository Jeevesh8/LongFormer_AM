Not all smartphones are created equal.
you may have an iPhone, and most of the ads you see are for buying the flagship Android or Apple product,
They use less data (e.g. images, animations, etc...) to make it easier to load on people with a poor 3G connection or a low data limit on their plan,
they often have much bigger buttons, text, and menus to work better for someone on a touch screen as opposed to someone on a computer.
