I suppose, the only issue with that is it's very subjective. 
Some users may like it, others may not. 
Most websites will let you scroll to the bottom and hit a button for mobile or desktop viewing. 
At least if it defaults to mobile, that 3G issue I mentioned means the website will load very quickly if you've got a good connection and let you scroll down and hit desktop right away, and then if you're on a poor connection you're not stuck waiting for the full website to load before being able to switch back to mobile. 
There's also some issues with flash animations and CS styles that not all mobile devices can handle, but that usually doesn't make a phone crash, it just might make a website fail to load some bits or look a little jenky.
