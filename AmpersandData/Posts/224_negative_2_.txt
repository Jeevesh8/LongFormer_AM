I've never really understood the demonization of "save-scumming" to be honest, especially in a single-player game. 
I don't personally view it as cheating at all, rather using the tools the game gives you. 
How often do we get to go back and correct our mistakes in real life, anyway? 
Why should a videogame be subject to the same limitations we have in reality?
