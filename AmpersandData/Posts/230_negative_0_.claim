simple enough that almost anyone could, if they were struck by the impulse to make that unusually large commitment, do so
I think the law should be simple enough that close to anybody could reasonably know the mechanics of all the laws likely to apply to them.
Ideally, it should be a relatively simple feat of memorization to learn the names of all the categories of law; the number of laws in each category; and the basic mechanics of the enforcement of that category's laws.
it should be well within the average citizen's capacity to know all the laws likely to apply to them, word-for-word or close to it.
