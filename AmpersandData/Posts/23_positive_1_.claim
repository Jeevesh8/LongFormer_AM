The only way your argument holds is if an extremely high percentage of these potential kids would have been unproductive members of society (if they were criminals, sucked up resources, drained society, etc)
Let's say an unproductive member of society is one who spends a large portion of their life in prison and/or unemployed.
It might be true that 42% of the aborted babies would have been [below the federal poverty line]
This implies that the vast majority of time spent by the aborted babies would have been spent *not* in an unproductive manner (i.e. not imprisoned or unemployed)
the aborted babies would have contributed more than they sucked up
your argument assumes that if those abortions never happened then we would have 55 million more people in the country.
I think is flawed
if abortions never happened, we would have more people, but not 55 million more
