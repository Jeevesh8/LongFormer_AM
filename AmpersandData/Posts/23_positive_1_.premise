most poor children don't become prisoners
most poor children don't become unemployed for the majority of their life
most prisoners only spend a fraction of their lives in prison - most of their life is free
many mothers who had abortions decided to have children later in their life
if they had not aborted their earlier pregnancies, then many of them would not have made that decision
had those abortions never occurred, then America's immigration policies would not have been so lax
there would be less need for unskilled labor, leading to less unskilled immigrants in exchange for more unskilled natives (all of whom would be tax-paying citizens, unlike all immigrants)
if abortions were not permitted, then people would be less likely to have unprotected sex out of fear of forced pregnancies
