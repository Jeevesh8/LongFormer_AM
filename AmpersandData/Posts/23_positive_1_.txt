The only way your argument holds is if an extremely high percentage of these potential kids would have been unproductive members of society (if they were criminals, sucked up resources, drained society, etc). 
Let's say an unproductive member of society is one who spends a large portion of their life in prison and/or unemployed. 
It might be true that 42% of the aborted babies would have been [below the federal poverty line](http://www.guttmacher.org/media/nr/2010/05/04/index.html) ; but (a) most poor children don't become prisoners, (b) most poor children don't become unemployed for the majority of their life, and (c) most prisoners only spend a fraction of their lives in prison - most of their life is free. 
This implies that the vast majority of time spent by the aborted babies would have been spent *not* in an unproductive manner (i.e. not imprisoned or unemployed). 
Therefore, the aborted babies would have contributed more than they sucked up.

Furthermore, your argument assumes that if those abortions never happened then we would have 55 million more people in the country. 
I think is flawed for a few reasons. 
Firstly, many mothers who had abortions decided to have children later in their life. 
But if they had not aborted their earlier pregnancies, then many of them would not have made that decision. 
Secondly, had those abortions never occurred, then America's immigration policies would not have been so lax as there would be less need for unskilled labor, leading to less unskilled immigrants in exchange for more unskilled natives (all of whom would be tax-paying citizens, unlike all immigrants). 
And lastly, if abortions were not permitted, then people would be less likely to have unprotected sex out of fear of forced pregnancies. 
Therefore, if abortions never happened, we would have more people, but not 55 million more.
