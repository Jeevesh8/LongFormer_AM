&gt;Nobody makes mistakes ever, so when they do, the relationship should end. My belief: obviously this isn't true, and a cornerstone of strong relationships is the ability to work through mistakes/issues together.

 Cheating isn't just a single mistake though.  
 It is a series of mistakes , and  each time the cheater made the "mistake," he or she was making *a conscious knowing decision to betray his or her spouse* several times in a row by the time physical cheating happens. 

 A "mistake" would be flirting back with the man or woman who flirts with you at a party while your spouse is away.  
 But to reach cheating, you have to not just flirt back, but also start touching, start kissing, start hugging, get to a private location, start undressing, and *then* start having sex.  
 That's no less than seven decisions one would have had to make before that person reaches sexual adultery.
