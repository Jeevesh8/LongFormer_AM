In college, I tend to find students who enjoy the subject. 
I recently took a class I enjoy, DSP. I had done previous DSP work for a couple semesters and had much more experience than almost everyone in class but I still put serious work in.

I put in serious work for this class, more work than any other class. 
I enjoyed it; how could I not? 
I feel I learned much more from this work and my grade was a result of this work. 
I have some more backing behind that; I took other classes I enjoyed but did not put in serious hours and didn't learn what I should (correspondingly I received a *good* but not *great* grade).
