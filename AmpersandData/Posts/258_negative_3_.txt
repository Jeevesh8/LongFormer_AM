So in the first case, it's hard to say whether you were truly good at the topic and just put in the time because you liked it, or if you needed the time.  

I never put in extra time on classes.  
The example of my theory was best evident in my CS classes:

A good portion of the class did well on assignments an tests.
Me and my friend did very well also.

The difference was, the majority of the class put in lots of time for assignments, prep, reading, and studying.
The two of us?  
We didn't even buy the books, much less read them.
