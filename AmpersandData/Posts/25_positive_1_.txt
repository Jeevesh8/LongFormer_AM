Before I respond, I'd suggest trying /r/asksocialscience for an actual academic-level answer. 
Almost everything regarding large scale financial collapses are /r/badeconomics territory (and routinely do show up there).

&gt;There have been 4 jobs or activities which Man has engaged in throughout the centuries

This is almost just a semantic argument.

&gt;workers will have nowhere to go but to the unemployment line.

Agriculture, manufacturing, and services have been getting better literally for milennia. 
There's no reason in particular for it to be *crossing the line* soon, especially within months.

&gt;At some point, Man's artificial economic system will necessarily collapse

Necessarily? This is just an assertion, not even a theoretical argument provided to back it up.

&gt;When that happens, the corporations which produce and deliver food will no longer have an incentive to do so

No explanation given for this either.

&gt;The current jobless situation you read about in the news is not an ordinary part of the business cycle

What is the current jobless situation? Unemployment's relatively low...

When you say economic collapse, what precisely do you mean? 
Market failures? 
Currency issues? 
A recession or depression? 
Bottom line is that people have predicted economic collapses literally since economies began. 
There is no reason in particular to believe one is impending. 
All of this is /r/conspiratard mixed with /r/badeconomics.
