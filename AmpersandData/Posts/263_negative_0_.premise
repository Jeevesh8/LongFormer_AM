"Why else do men engage women in conversation in public?"
Why do I feel like chasing after girls and getting to know them when I have so many great guy friends already who I know care about me so much more?
Why can't I be friends with girls (even pretty ones) and not feel insecure when I don't try to advance some romantic agenda?
Why do I find myself inevitably becoming attracted to them?
because I want to know what older, more mature people think
the man tries to show the woman how non-threatening and valuable he is from a non-romantic standpoint before she is comfortable with allowing herself to think of him as a safe partner
Something about that seems so sinister, cynical, and hollow to me
