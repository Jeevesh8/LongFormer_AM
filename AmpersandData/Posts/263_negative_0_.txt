Maybe it has to do with being an adolescent and being new to dealing with the opposite sex, but I'm beginning to fall under the assumption that the only purpose for guys to get to know girls is to eventually engage in romance.

"Why else do men engage women in conversation in public?" I wonder (my perception might just be distorted after reading Neil Strauss's *The Game*).
"Why do I feel like chasing after girls and getting to know them when I have so many great guy friends already who I know care about me so much more? Why can't I be friends with girls (even pretty ones) and not feel insecure when I don't try to advance some romantic agenda?
Why do I find myself inevitably becoming attracted to them?"

I have so many more questions regarding the non-romantic side of male-female relationships, but instead of writing an abhorrent block of text nobody could possibly be expected to read, I ask just the one title question (thinking that the above questions are more like fragments of a bigger picture of misunderstanding) because I want to know what older, more mature people think.
It also must distort my view to have gone to an all-boy's school for the majority of my life.

At times, I feel like the interplay between men and women is always (at least always initially) a bs game where the man tries to show the woman how non-threatening and valuable he is from a non-romantic standpoint before she is comfortable with allowing herself to think of him as a safe partner.
Something about that seems so sinister, cynical, and hollow to me that I can't stand it.
Please change this view.
