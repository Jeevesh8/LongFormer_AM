I'm a middle aged female.

Quit putting the pussy on a pedestal. 
If you think that the only reason to get to know a female is to bone her you are doing 2 things 1) dehumanizing females a placing them in a category separate from yourself- almost like a separate class or subspecies... For an extreme example of this look at some Arab cultures where women have few rights and can't even show 1 square inch of forearm lest a man be tempted. 
2) elevating a woman's  sexuality to a higher plane than where it deserves to be. 
You are. Really.
Knock that pedestal over. 
Women aren't putting your dick up there, don't put the pussy up there. 
It just makes a guy look a little desperate when he treats a woman and her vagina like a magical unicorn. 
Nobody worth dating really wants that in my book. 
You may think you aren't guilty of this but by virtue of the fact that you think the sole goal of befriending a female is to fuck her, you are.
You are making the pussy very valuable. 
Making friends with a lot of women actually devalues the shit out of it even if you aren't hitting it. 
Which long term is a really great thing.

Continuing to think of women as magical pussy creatures who aren't worth befriending or even talking to unless you can eventually stick your cock into them is not a good way to form a healthy relationship if you manage to form one at all with those beliefs. 

I've always had lots of male friends. 
I just don't get along with women. 
I'm straight. 
I don't want to have relations with any of my male friends and afaik they don't expect any sex from me. 
They all know I've been married for 12 years and am loyal. 
All we do is hang out and play video games or board games and drink beer (admittedly its rare that I have the time with 2 kids to do this). 
My husband is 100% OK with this and trusts me completely.
