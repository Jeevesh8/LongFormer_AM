I've always had a respect for the men in uniform and I've always wanted to join.
Recently I've disagreed with the practices of the U.S. military but that doesn't mean that I hate the Warriors, just the people that force them into it.
I'm an immigrant and a Muslim neither of which is or should be a deterrent from joining.
I want to be a doctor, not because of familial pressure but of a genuine need to help.
So here's where I am now: currently in first year of college studying biology, enough AP credits to be a tiny bit ahead of my classmates, an itching to explore this giant world God gave me, I'm also poor and medical school in the military (from what I understand) pays for smart kids.
Also, please forgive me if this is wrong or arrogant or whatever, I want the respect that people give men and women in the military.

My plan was to graduate College and join the USHS (the military medical school) and become and Army doctor.
The only reservation that I had was that it would be a waste of my time because I want to be a neurosurgeon and that's a looooooooong and rigorous path and that I might be losing precious time by joining the military.
My mom doesn't want me to join for that reason.
Other things that I've considered: I love the idea of a brotherhood but I don't agree with the ideology, the military putting me through Med school will help me jump start life, I'm very inexperienced and haven't seen much of the world and this I think will help me.

I look forward to having my views challenged!
Thanks!
