I think you need to get a bit better informed if you're going with those particular stereotypes. 
Did you know the Army's minimum ASVAB score is lower than the Marines, for instance? 
As for getting seasick, it's not as much of an issue on such large ships. 
Don't go for the Coast Guard though, that's for sure. 
And there is actually a decent chance to never set foot on a ship. 
Especially since the Marines don't have their own medical services. 
The Navy provides them.

In the end, I'd probably recommend the Airforce for you. 
When you join the military, you sign a contract that gives you a specific(or not so specific if you join the Marines) job. 
If there is a slot open for a doctor in the Airforce, they'll put in in your contract. 
If there isn't, you can either wait or go to another branch.

Can I ask how much you actually know about actually *being in the military?* 
I don't want to offend you, but a lot of people looking to join tend to forget that bit, when it's really the most important part. 
All when the clostest they've been to military life are movies which are either terrible representations or great representations of *very specific parts* of the military.

You won't be a *doctor in the military*, you will be a *military doctor.* 
That's why I recommend the Air Force. 
Out of all the branches, it has the most in common with the civilian world in regards to its culture. 
It's only 60 something years old, after all.
