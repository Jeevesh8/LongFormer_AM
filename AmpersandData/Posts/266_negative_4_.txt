Okay, thanks so much for the info! 
I think I still have a lot to research but my main reason against the marines was that they are very homogeneous. 
From all the marines that I've met they all think and act the same way to the point where it freaks me out a little. 
They subscribe to the same pages on facebook and whatnot, it's a little creep tbh. 
I'm definitely going to look at the airforce, thanks to what you've suggested!
