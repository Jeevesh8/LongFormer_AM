I guess my question for you would be: what is inherently wrong with seeking attention?

If you're doing so in a way that takes away from others, I can see the problem: e.g., if you're one of those people who feels the need to one-up *every* story at a party, you might need to learn to chill out and share the spotlight.

But if your contributions are welcome and socially appropriate (e.g., you're not spamming the subreddit with new posts), then why does the "attention seeking" (if that's what it is) strike you as being a problem?
