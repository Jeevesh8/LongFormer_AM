Making a political statement is not the same as organizing a boycott.
Vegans live the way they do because they feel a certain way about the way we exploit animals.
I think you are misinterpreting their motives.
I don't believe in donating to the Salvation Army, for example, because there have been incidents in the past where their organization has denied aid to homosexuals and publicly expressed homophobic views.
I do NOT believe that my actions will bring about the demise of the Salvation Army, or really have any effect at all.
That is not my motive.
