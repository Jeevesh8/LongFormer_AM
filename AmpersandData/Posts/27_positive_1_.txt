Making a political statement is not the same as organizing a boycott. 
Vegans live the way they do because they feel a certain way about the way we exploit animals. 
However, I strongly, strongly doubt they believe that in doing so, they are making great strides in improving conditions for animals. 
I think you are misinterpreting their motives.

I don't believe in donating to the Salvation Army, for example, because there have been incidents in the past where their organization has denied aid to homosexuals and publicly expressed homophobic views. 
However, I do NOT believe that my actions will bring about the demise of the Salvation Army, or really have any effect at all. 
That is not my motive. 
That would just be delusional. 
I think the vast majority of vegans and vegetarians are not delusional and feel similarly about the meat industry as I do about the Salvation Army.
