Are you sure? 
I mean, if you've met people like that, they're wrong, simple as that. 
And they don't represent the majority of vegans, that's for sure. 

But I strongly doubt there are people who actually think, "not eating meat is *definitely* the BEST THING I can do for animal welfare!" 
That makes zero sense. 
Even if they think that being vegan is a way to directly improve conditions for animals, I don't think they believe it's the *best* way. 
Sorry but I think this is a strawman argument.
