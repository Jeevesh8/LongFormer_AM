It's good to know that this view doesn't make up the majority of vegans. 
The vegans who believe the way I've described and who made up a good chunk of the vegans I've encountered, were a large part of my inspiration to write this CMV. 
That plus the fact that a large portion of the vegan advocacy I've seen revolves around the horrors of factory farming which, I believe, would be far more effectively reduced by responsible carnivory than by veganism.

I don't quite think that makes my argument a strawman, or incorrect, but your point is well-taken. âˆ†
