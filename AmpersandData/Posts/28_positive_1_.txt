 In terms of evolution, the question is erroneous.  
 The ancestral organism from which the chicken is derived never gave bith to a chicken egg.  
 There is no sharp line representing a single generation that became chickens.  
 The newly defined chicken species (a species is hard enough to define as it is) is not recognized as a new species of chickens until you already have an independently reproducing population.  
Though  there were ancestral species that produced eggs,   due to the gradual process that produces what we call new species and how we define them, there was never a single egg that gave rise to the first chicken.
