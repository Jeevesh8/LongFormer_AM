 if scientists had enough evidence a distinction would be made. 
 Where ever the distinction would be made, wouldn't that make the egg first? 
 And if you define a species as an independently reproducing population I think both comes at the same time. 
 When that happens the egg becomes a chicken egg and the X becomes a chicken.
