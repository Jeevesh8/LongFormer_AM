While  the dividing line between species is quite arbitrary ,  if scientists had enough evidence a distinction would be made.  
 Species are labeled by humans, but really we are all similar life.  
 Where ever the distinction would be made, wouldn't that make the egg first? 

 And if you define a species as an independently reproducing population I think both comes at the same time.  
 An independently reproductive community of animals should only be defined as such once their chicken babies are layed or hatched.  
 When that happens the egg becomes a chicken egg and the X becomes a chicken. 

You sort of C'd my V.

I'll give you a delta once I go learn how.
