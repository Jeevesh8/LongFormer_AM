Ive seen a lot of animated movies in my life but in my opinion they dont stand up to the Brave Little Toaster.
The animation is very solid for being made in the 1980`s and I absolutely love the inanimate objects journey to try and find their master.
One very tense scene for me was when the vacuum cleaner was trying to cross the canyon.
However whenever people bring up animated movies they never bring up the Brave Little Toaster.
I feel like this masterpiece is largely unappreciated by a majority of people in favor of other animated movies.

Reddit I think the Brave Little Toaster needs some more attention and some more love.
