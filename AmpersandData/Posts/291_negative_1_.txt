The fact that it's underrated largely stems from the fact that by today's measure it's far from a children's movie, which unfortunately in western countries is generally the target demographic for animated features. 

The same could be said for a lot of Animated movies from the 80s, Like Transformers, or Starchaser or Rock and Rule. 

It's too dark, and almost violent. 

Some examples would be, when the Flower observes it's own reflection in the toaster, and dies from loneliness when the toaster leaves.

The appliances that have their parts ripped out, are effectively a commentary on black market organ sales.


The cars singing "You're worthless." and the Toaster killing himself for the master.


I grew up watching the movie, and it doesn't bug me but so did a lot of moms my age, and when the alternative is Adventure Time or My Little Pony, I'm likely to think that Brave Little Toaster isn't good viewing material for kids in 2014. 
Concepts like death or dying in children's features are incredibly out of favor right now. 
You can make arguments for something like Toy Story, but those franchises have been out for over 15 years, and so they get a pass from the now adults who enjoyed the movies as kids.
