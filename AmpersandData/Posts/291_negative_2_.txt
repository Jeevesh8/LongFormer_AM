There have been a great many "dark" animated movies and shows that grew to become extremely famous. 
If we`re using a level of "dark" of the level of Brave Little Toaster then why did things like The Iron Giant and Land Before Time get a ton of love associated with them. 
Especially when one contains a death of someones mom and the other almost had an entire town nuked as well as a giant death machine moving through.
