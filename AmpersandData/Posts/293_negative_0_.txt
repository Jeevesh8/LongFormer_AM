Obviously I'm not there right now, but I'm curious if anyone can put my mind at ease that I shouldn't be.

Feels to me as if Putin senses weakness in the Western world,  with the US and Europe driven farther apart by issues like privacy and human rights, the US withdrawing as a dominant force in geopolitics, because people in and outside of the US are fed up with the US policing the world.
His territorial pissings seems to be meant to elbow some room for himself on the geopolitical stage, in other words gaining power.
Putin is a totalitarian, oppressive, ruthless man, and allowing him to gain more power will affect all of us.
