In the last few weeks we've had two huge events happen in the world, both of which were caused by matters relating to "freedom of speech." The first being the hacking of Sony over The Interview, and today the shooting at the offices of a satirical magazine in Paris.
I certainly value our free speech but to me there is a clear line between exercising your first amendment right ("President Obama sucks!" etc) and doing things that are known to be offensive to other cultures (Satirical cartoons of prophets, assassinating leaders, etc).

 Perhaps this is a bad analogy - but if you say something antagonizing to a bully and you get your ass kicked, you should have anticipated that outcome.
