&gt; Perhaps this is a bad analogy - but if you say something antagonizing to a bully and you get your ass kicked, you should have anticipated that outcome.

Sure, but that doesn't mean we condone the bully's actions and don't punish the bullies for acting. 
We want to live in a world without bullies, whether those bullies act on behalf of beliefs, religions, countries, or even out own governments. 
Complete freedom in the expression of any idea, offensive or not, is a major element of that world. 

If you want to protect the freedom to speak for any of us, you have to protect the freedom to speak for all of us.
