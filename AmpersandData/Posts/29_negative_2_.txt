I certainly agree with your points - I didn't mean to imply that I was only for **some** freedom of speech. 
I just think lately there's been a lot of antagonistic material being published and everyone cries freedom of speech when certain groups get upset.

Why can't America be the bigger person and say "Ok, we won't publish certain types of material, not because we're afraid of you but because we respect your views."
Is that so hard?
