âˆ† This comment changed my view, because you said that people love their country, even if their country isn't objectively the best. 
This is mostly illustrated in the following sentences "Patriotism simply says "America is a good country. 
its not the best, and it might be better or worse than other countries, but i still love and respect it", and "they do not have a belief that they are better. 
they have the belief that they are American, and would prefer their country over other countries, regardless of who's better".
