Bill Gates is one of the wealthiest people in the world and he devotes a substantial portion of his wealth to philanthropy. 
He is not alone in this. 
While there are rich assholes, many wealthy people use their money to try to improve the world. 
What makes you think these same people will turn around and start slaughtering everyone as soon as automation improves?
