I've noticed that nearly everyone in Washington is extremely old. 
I have always thought that that was a bad thing, because of a few reasons: 1.  if you are already old, then the long-term consequences of your decisions probably won't happen until after you are gone, but will be horrible for all of us that are still around, 

2.
if you are already retired, then you wouldn't know what it is like for a working person today, especially someone struggling to live paycheck-to-paycheck.

TL;DR: old people shouldn't be in politics because the consequences of their decisions won't affect them, and they don't understand what the circumstances of today are.
