Should young adults with trust funds not be allowed to vote
What about terminally ill adults?
What about the unemployed?
I assume this is what you are really getting at, "can the old people just die so we can have some progress already!?!?"
You are making the argument that because they aren't living through what younger generations are living through then they can't make informed voting decisions regarding those people.
