Should young adults with trust funds not be allowed to vote because they don't know what it is like to live pay check to pay check? 
What about terminally ill adults? 
They wont experience long term consequences. 
What about the unemployed? 
They don't pay income tax so they don't contribute (for the sake of argument). 
Can we just start taking away the voting rights of everyone who has a different political ideology than you (I assume this is what you are really getting at, "can the old people just die so we can have some progress already!?!?")?

Also, if old people can't vote than who will represent their interests? 
You are making the argument that because they aren't living through what younger generations are living through then they can't make informed voting decisions regarding those people. 
Well how can you expect young people who haven't experienced being old to make informed voting decisions regarding retirement? You could say that young people will vote in interests of creating the best retirements because they will some day retire but do you really expect people to prioritizes decades in the future over the short term?
