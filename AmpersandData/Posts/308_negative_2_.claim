This actually is a good point.
I would be inclined to say that terminally ill people shouldn't be elected either
In my view, I'd say that homeless people would be ideal for leaders
I still believe it is a good idea
I really don't think that the over 62 demographic has any concerns that effect (affect?) just them.
As you mentioned, it will directly impact them in the future.
