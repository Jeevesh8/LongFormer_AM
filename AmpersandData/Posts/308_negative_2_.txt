&gt; Should young adults with trust funds not be allowed to vote because they don't know what it is like to live pay check to pay check? What about terminally ill adults? They wont experience long term consequences. What about the unemployed? They don't pay income tax so they don't contribute (for the sake of argument). Can we just start taking away the voting rights of everyone who has a different political ideology than you (I assume this is what you are really getting at, "can the old people just die so we can have some progress already!?!?")?

This actually is a good point.  
I would be inclined to say that terminally ill people shouldn't be elected either, because they wouldn't have to deal with the consequences either.  
In my view, I'd say that homeless people would be ideal for leaders, since they know exactly what the problems are, although they don't contribute financially.  
Still, this (especially the trust fund part) is making me realize it isn't a perfect idea, although I still believe it is a good idea.  

&gt; Also, if old people can't vote than who will represent their interests?

I really don't think that the over 62 demographic has any concerns that effect (affect?) just them.

&gt; Well how can you expect young people who haven't experienced being old to make informed voting decisions regarding retirement?

As you mentioned, it will directly impact them in the future.

&gt; do you really expect people to prioritizes decades in the future over the short term?

I realize that they won't always prioritize long-term interests, but at least they have a reason to, unlike old people.

Hope I covered everything.
