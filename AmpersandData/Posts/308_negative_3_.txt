&gt; In my view, I'd say that homeless people would be ideal for leaders, since they know exactly what the problems are, although they don't contribute financially. 

I get where you are coming from but I think you are putting too much stock in the idea that you can only empathize and understand a situation if you have lived through it. 
I grant you that there is merit to that idea but, lets be frank, if someone is doesn't have their life together to the point where they are out on the streets, how can we expect them to lead anything? 
This is why politicians have advisors on staff, so that they can get "expert" opinions when they are under educated on an issue.  
America (and every other country in the world for that matter) has a vast array of problems ranging from social to economic to geopolitical, for this reason its better to have someone who is an effective problem solver.
While a homeless person might have some very valuable insight on dealing with life on the streets, that doesn't mean they would have strong ideas on how to actually go about solving that problem, not to mention on how to deal with America's complicated relationship with China (for example). 
This is why you see so many older people in politics, it takes time to build the experience (and contacts/wealth/name recognition) to be able to handle the massive amount of varying problems politicians face.
