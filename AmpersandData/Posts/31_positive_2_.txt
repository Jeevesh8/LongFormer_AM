âˆ† A lot of good arguments have been made but I think you brought up some other valid points that others didn't.

I think another thing is that over the years the sense of humor has just been lost to me. 
I don't feel like calling someone a fag is all that funny anymore and I don't want to be in on the joke, so I end up taking things seriously instead.
