 Most of what you said is either patently false or simplification to the point of absurdity,  but  more importantly has nothing to do with whether or not America is a democracy.  
 Democracies can be oppressive illiberal regimes, totalitarian systems, command-and-control socialist systems, social democracies, liberal capitalist states, oligarchies etc.  
 You have yet to give evidence that there is widespread tampering with free and fair elections which define the US as a democratic state. 

 For example: according to you a democracy is defined as "a state which has strict financial regulations, outlaws fracking,  and  doesn't have a spy network".  
You'd get an F in government class I suppose.
