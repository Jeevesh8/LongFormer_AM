&gt; I know this would be a bitch to implement and it's near impossible to actually do, but I'm just looking at the concept

The problem is, this is really the main reason not to do it.  
How do you prevent people from having more than the allotted number of children? 
Forced sterilization?  
Forced abortions?  
Prison? 
Fines?  
Taking away the children?  
All of these are terrible options, and there aren't any good ones.
