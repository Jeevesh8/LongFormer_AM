 Perhaps laissez faire capitalism (or of the chain-gang bullshit going on in the gilded age), 
 In fact, Adam Smith (origin of laissez faire) did not like landowners, 
 saying that they did very little to improve the economy/society 
 just sit on their land charging whatever damn price they want. 
 at that point I think that is a little too deep for a board game :P
