 Perhaps laissez faire capitalism (or of the chain-gang bullshit going on in the gilded age),  but  I doubt it is a criticism of capitalism in general.   
 In fact, Adam Smith (origin of laissez faire) did not like landowners,   saying that they did very little to improve the economy/society  and  just sit on their land charging whatever damn price they want.  
 It could be a criticism that despite that piece of advice we have fallen into that trap,  though  at that point I think that is a little too deep for a board game :P
