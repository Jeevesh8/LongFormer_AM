 -What about a one parent household? 
 -What is the state of the school? 
 Is this an unfunded, understaffed, inner city school? 
 -What if the child is being bullied/abused without the parents knowledge? 
 -Does this child have other, non LD problems(i.e. emotional, gender-identity)? 
 Do those parents receive your proposed monetary incentive?
