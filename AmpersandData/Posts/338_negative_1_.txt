 I don't know man, raising a child is hard.   You are leaving out so many factors. 

 -What about a one parent household? 

 -What is the state of the school?  
 Is this an unfunded, understaffed, inner city school? 

 -What if the child is being bullied/abused without the parents knowledge? 

 -Does this child have other, non LD problems(i.e. emotional, gender-identity)? 


 On top of all of that what about the child that does well despite a parents shittiness?  
 Do those parents receive your proposed monetary incentive? 

 I think the correlation is there, but to say 100% is too much of an absolute.
