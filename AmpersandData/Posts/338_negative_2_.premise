 So what? Again, many children come from handicapped households.
 I subscribe to the idea that there is no such thing as too much parenting. 
 Of course, with more involvement comes more responsibility to surgically manage involvement, emotions, rewards and punishments. 
 After building in requirements for parents to attend a weekly P/T meeting and/or more, 
 I think we could minimize the amount of shitty parents getting paid, 
 instead deposit that money into a trust for the student, paid upon graduation.
