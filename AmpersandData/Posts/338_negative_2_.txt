&gt;What about a one parent household?

 So what? Again, many children come from handicapped households. 
 Why do some individuals call them excuses and others, motivation? 

 Really most of your problems you presented can be counteracted  and  even turned for benefit with a proper level of parental involvement.  
 I subscribe to the idea that there is no such thing as too much parenting.  
 Of course, with more involvement comes more responsibility to surgically manage involvement, emotions, rewards and punishments. 

 The last point about a shitty parent with a good student is, at first, a quandary.  
 After building in requirements for parents to attend a weekly P/T meeting and/or more,   I think we could minimize the amount of shitty parents getting paid,  and  instead deposit that money into a trust for the student, paid upon graduation.
