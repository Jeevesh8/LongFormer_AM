there have absolutely been times when gun ownership, or carrying weapons on ones person in general was more prevalent than it is today.
the murder rate was "extraordinarily high by today's standard." 
The incidents that stand out most in our heads are events like Paris or Aurora or Columbine- premeditated shootings with the intent of inflicting a lot of casualties.
If the staff at Charlie Hebdo or Columbine High had guns, they certainly might have been able to end these incidents earlier.
They also might have inflicted more casualties with stray bullets.
These types of hypothetical calculations aren't really helpful, in my opinion.
premeditated murders could well be less likely,
accidental deaths, unplanned homicides, and suicides would like increase. 
This study found that owning a gun makes one more likely to die from suicide *and* homicide.
it certainly suggests that owning a gun doesn't automatically make you safer.
