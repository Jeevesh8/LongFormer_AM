I guess I look at it this way- there have absolutely been times when gun ownership, or carrying weapons on ones person in general was more prevalent than it is today.
Those time periods/places did not enjoy lower rates of violent death. 

Consider the "wild west." 
Obviously it wasn't nearly as full of gun battles as the movies make it seem, but according [this study] (http://cjrc.osu.edu/homicide-rates-american-west-randolph-roth) 
the murder rate was "extraordinarily high by today's standard." 

Looking at the rest of the thread, I think I see what might be a flaw in our collective logic. 
The incidents that stand out most in our heads are events like Paris or Aurora or Columbine- premeditated shootings with the intent of inflicting a lot of casualties. 
If the staff at Charlie Hebdo or Columbine High had guns, they certainly might have been able to end these incidents earlier. 
They also might have inflicted more casualties with stray bullets. 
These types of hypothetical calculations aren't really helpful, in my opinion.

But lets assume that more guns makes mass shootings less likely. 
Would this actually make a more heavily armed society a more polite one?

I don't think it would, because though premeditated murders could well be less likely, accidental deaths, unplanned homicides, and suicides would like increase. 

This study found that owning a gun makes one more likely to die from suicide *and* homicide. 
Of course, that's correlation, so there might be some third factor at play that makes gun owners more likely to b targets of crime or clinically depressed, but it certainly suggests that owning a gun doesn't automatically make you safer.

Whether or not more guns would prevent events like today's isn't the issue (though I am inclined to say they wouldn't necessarily do that), it seems like a greater proliferation of weapons would be more dangerous for a number of other reasons.
