I'm sure with the right culture it would
maintaining a culture is hard.
the role of these people would be to defend themselves and those around them.
It wouldn't help deterring suicide attacks, and would most probably cause few more deaths from mistakes and irresponsibility, with a danger of this worsening.
when they find a safe hiding place or cover they have a chance getting themselves in a position where they can use the paralyzer on the attacker.
This would have most of the benefits as with what I imagined with guns except it might be less probable to work against well prepared attackers (against heavy clothing),
it could also deter from suicide attacks as they usually count on not being caught alive and of course it always is best for the attacker to be brought to justice in court.
