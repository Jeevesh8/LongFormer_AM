Yeah I was considering this and was already doubtful of the benefits would outweigh the potential negatives. 
I'm sure with the right culture it would, but maintaining a culture is hard. 
Like I said the role of these people would be to defend themselves and those around them. 
It wouldn't help deterring suicide attacks, and would most probably cause few more deaths from mistakes and irresponsibility, with a danger of this worsening. 
In cases of mass shootings like you outlined, which are the situations I am thinking of, it would perhaps be best that these people wouldn't be armed with a gun but a paralyzer (taser), so when they find a safe hiding place or cover they have a chance getting themselves in a position where they can use the paralyzer on the attacker. 
This would have most of the benefits as with what I imagined with guns except it might be less probable to work against well prepared attackers (against heavy clothing), but on the other hand it could also deter from suicide attacks as they usually count on not being caught alive and of course it always is best for the attacker to be brought to justice in court.

Although you haven't suggested this, your post lead my thoughts to it, so have a delta for that:

PS: Re the study, well of course it doesn't suggest that. 
These studies seem to fuel only the flawed arguments based on correlation.
