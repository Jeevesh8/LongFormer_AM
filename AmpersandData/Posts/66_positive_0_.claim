There isn't a single instance where a mobile website is preferable to a full site
it outweighs the "some people don't have smartphones" argument
"Websites should not default force mobile and have the option to go default and instead start default and allow mobile."
It's very off putting and doesn't encourage me, as op, to continue discussing my view
