What if time itself is an illusion, and we really do live forever? 

Consider a novel. 
As you read through the novel, you go from page to page, eventually reaching the end.
But does the novel stop existing just because you finished the book? 
Or does the book continue to exist, with it's words, chapters, stories, characters, and lives intact? 

"Now" is *the page you are reading at this moment*.
But just because there are pages you've already read, or pages you have yet to read, doesn't mean those pages don't exist.
And all those pages will continue to exist, even after you've finished your book.
