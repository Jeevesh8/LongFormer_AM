Time isn't "real" in the same sense that we experience it
We are simply at one point along a path, and that's the "now"
All the other points in time exist as much as the current point in time, however
Let's say I travel from home to the grocery store
I leave my apartment, go down the elevator, out on the street, past the cigar shop, past the empty parking lot, and finally to the store
 Now* I'm at the store, but did my apartment, my elevator, the street I walked on, the cigar shop, and the empty parking lot cease to exist simply because I'm not there *right now*?
