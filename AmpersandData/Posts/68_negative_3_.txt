I wouldn't consider it pointless if I derived pleasure from reading it at the time.

 I mean if you really believe that everything that does not last forever is pointless, why do you do anything?   Why not sit in a corner and stare at a wall until you die? 
I would guess that it's because you derive pleasure from certain things in life and that you pursue these things just like everyone else does.
