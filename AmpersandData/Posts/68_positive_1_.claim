I entirely agree that certain parts are unnecessarily complex and complicated
a substantial degree of complexity is necessary for certain aspects to function.
a lot of it is necessary for a functional judicial system to determine what is and is not legal.
We could create a system that simply pointed to morally impermissible actions as illegal, but that would lead to large discrepancies (or would need have some other system to define what is morally impermissible, out of scope of a high schooler's memory).
In order to eliminate discrepancies, the system needs to codify at least some specific instances, and by doing such for an immense number of actions we go beyond, well, *any* one person's memory.
