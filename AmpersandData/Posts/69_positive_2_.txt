2nd reply: I will grant that changing the US laws would not change international laws, and the systems of treaties necessary to interface with other countries' economies would be complex in proportion to the complexities of those countries' economic law.
So, you get a delta for that point.
&#8710; I do think that the actual practice of economics would become drastically simpler if the law were simpler internationally (in ways that I respect would still be complicated) but I agree with the point you didn't necessarily actually make that reforming all the countries' economic legal systems to be simpler in compatible ways at the same time is a way bigger implausibility than reforming just one country's economic law in a way that is self-consistent.
