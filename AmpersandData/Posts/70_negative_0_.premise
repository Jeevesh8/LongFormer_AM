For those of you who don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s common (at least in the US) for businesses, transit agencies, etc. to give small discounts to military veterans to thank them for their service.
As for the &#8220;They&#8217;re not risking their lives for our country.&#8221; argument, police officers do that too, and for citizens rather than the country and its interests
Some might argue that soldiers do the US a disservice rather than help
that&#8217;s [usually] the fault of their leaders and therefore not relevant to the debate
[It looks like there&#8217;s even less reason behind it than I initially thought, actually.]
