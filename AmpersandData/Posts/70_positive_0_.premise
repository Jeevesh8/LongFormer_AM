I'll preface this by saying I'm a fan of both the books and movies.
When watching the theatrical cuts, I get swept into the story.
When watching the extended cuts, I get distracted, and reminded that I'm watching a movie.
They break the fourth wall, if you will.
Peter Jackson agrees with me:
The main objection to this, of course, will be that the extended cuts are able to include more scenes from the books, and are therefore better.
They stretched some scenes from brief chapters into center pieces (Helms's Deep) and cut out some of the more... esoteric portions completely (Tom Bombadil).
