And I tried.
I loved The Hobbit, even though it got slow
I found Tolkien's prose to be far too slow-paced and filled with inane babbling about things too far removed from the plot.
I get more engaged in an audio-visual medium than I do into books, as a general rule
the extended trilogy let me really grasp the world of Middle Earth for the first time.
I'm the sort of person who, despite not really liking to read, will read summaries about the world surrounding my favorite movies or video games
these are things I *want to know* but typically aren't in the film/game, so I endure the chore.
most of the answers to that on the internet before were "If you want to know more you should just read the damn books, scrub!" because nerds are like that sometimes.
