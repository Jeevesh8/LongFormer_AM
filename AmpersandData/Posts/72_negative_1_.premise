A coffee shop in Seattle might very well decide to have a local firefighters discount
I can name a few that do.
But should they honor a vacationing firefighter from Omaha?
How can he prove he's a firefighter?
Why should a Seattlite care that a man's employed by a city in Nebraska?
While states may have local branches of National Guard, active duty military members serve the nation as a whole and carry one (1) form of identification that is accepted *everywhere.*
This simplifies the discount process
