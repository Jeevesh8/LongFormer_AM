You haven't really participated in this thread, but I'd like to point out federal vs. municipal difference when it comes to location of the discount.

A coffee shop in Seattle might very well decide to have a local firefighters discount, (I can name a few that do.)
But should they honor a vacationing firefighter from Omaha?
How can he prove he's a firefighter?
Why should a Seattlite care that a man's employed by a city in Nebraska?

While states may have local branches of National Guard, active duty military members serve the nation as a whole and carry one (1) form of identification that is accepted *everywhere.*

This simplifies the discount process and may point to a succinct reason why they tend to receive a blanket discount in most areas of the US.
