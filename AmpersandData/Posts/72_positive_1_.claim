I don't think this depends as much on the cheater as the person he/she cheated on.
Nobody "should" be forgiven for cheating
I'm comfortable saying that anyone who knowingly betrays the trust of a relationship would deserve losing that relationship.
I wouldn't go so far as to say that it's expected to break up with the cheater
