Some people are unable to stay with an unfaithful partner and should not be pressured into continuing a relationship after that point.
Forgiveness depends on the forgiver, not the perpetrator.
some people are willing to be forgiving.
But I can't envision a situation where cheating "should" be forgiven.
Forgiveness is a gift, not an expectation.
