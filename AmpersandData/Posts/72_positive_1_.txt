I don't think this depends as much on the cheater as the person he/she cheated on.
Some people are unable to stay with an unfaithful partner and should not be pressured into continuing a relationship after that point.
Forgiveness depends on the forgiver, not the perpetrator.

Nobody "should" be forgiven for cheating, and I'm comfortable saying that anyone who knowingly betrays the trust of a relationship would deserve losing that relationship.
I wouldn't go so far as to say that it's expected to break up with the cheater, because some people are willing to be forgiving.
But I can't envision a situation where cheating "should" be forgiven.
Forgiveness is a gift, not an expectation.
