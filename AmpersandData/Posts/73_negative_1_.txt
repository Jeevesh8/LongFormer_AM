&gt;1. You don't agree with what is going on and stop supporting it.

Stop supporting it how?
As in never buying meat again, even as you know that doing so will not have any impact on the meat industry whatsoever, and won't make even an ounce of difference in the lives of animals?
What's the point?
If I stop eating meat today, it won't make any difference whatsoever and won't save even a single animal's life.

The only way to make real change in industries like this is to organize and participate in a boycott on a wide-scale level, and/or to petition the government to make regulation changes.
