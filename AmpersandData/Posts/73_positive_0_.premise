The DSM-IV defines delusion as:
A false belief based on incorrect inference about external reality that is firmly sustained despite what almost everyone else believes and despite what constitutes incontrovertible and obvious proof or evidence to the contrary.
If someone walks around genuinely convinced they are Jesus, the person is delusional
others would want to see that person medicated or receiving some form of psychiatric treatment for that persons own benefit.
But out of fear of offending and looking like an insensitive bigot, no one would respond to an otherkin in the same way they would someone claiming ultimate divinity.
