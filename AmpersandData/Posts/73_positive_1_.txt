Since you mentioned the DSM IV, it is worth pointing out that all of the disorders listed in the DSM IV have one central piece of criteria that is at the heart of the diagnostic process (which I believe you've missed), and that has to do with the degree to which the disorder is disruptive not only to the person who has the disorder, but to the general public as well (if you doubt this, read through the criteria for any disorder listed in the DSM).

Generally speaking, delusions themselves are arguably less relevant to whether or not a behavior is indicative of a disorder than are the social repercussions of that behavior.
Take for instance being "taken by the holy spirit".
From an outside perspective, this certainly appears to me to be a delusional behavior, but of course this alone is not enough for it to meet the criteria of a particular disorder.
As people can engage in all kinds of delusional behavior and often still function in the world quite well, this is not sufficient evidence for whether or not something should or should not be constituted as evidence of a disorder.

The belief that one has an animal spirit is not new and has been a component of many primitive animistic cultures throughout history, and certain Native American practices still have vestiges of this, though most of us wouldn't describe them as "delusional" simply because they follow the traditions of their ancestors as they've been practiced for centuries.

While you may find the practice disingenuous or disgusting, this is not reason enough to hold the behavior as evidence of a specific disorder in and of itself, and in cases where there may be genuine mental illness involved, I believe that there's enough criteria already set forth in the DSM to diagnose these conditions accurately without directly addressing this particular cultural phenomenon as some kind of mental health outlier.
