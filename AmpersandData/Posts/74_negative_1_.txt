&gt; You don't care about animals, so you're content with paying for them to be abused for your pleasure.

What about "I care about animals, but see it as a necessary evil for my sustenance."

I feel the same way about animals in medical research. I feel terrible for the animals, but it's necessary for the health of humans and a better option than researching on humans.
