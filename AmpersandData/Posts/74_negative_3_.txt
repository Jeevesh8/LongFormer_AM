I am an omnivore, and my diet consists of meat and plants.
There is not a good way to supply meat at an industrial scale that doesn't involve some measure of suffering for the animal.

We could trade information back and forth as to whether or not it's possible to be happy and healthy without meat, but I'm firmly convinced that meat is a requirement for my diet.
