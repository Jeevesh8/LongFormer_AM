&gt; Meat is the industry that creates the most suffering for animals though... Being the one that requires the most land usage and causes the most environmental issues as well as obviously slaughtering them.

This doesn't really matter if it is something that is necessary.

&gt; Vegans are also the group least likely to die of heart disease, with vegetarians being second and omnivores being first (or the same, depending on which study you're looking at). I'm convinced it's a healthier diet, which is a nice bonus for being compassionate.

[This study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20479151) shows that unprocessed meat is not linked to heart disease, but processed meat is.
I would also argue that a vegan *has* to be more conscious about their diet, and that extra attention results in health benefits.

Many people consider fish to be extremely healthy, and often include it in their "vegetarian" diets.
Eating fish has been associated with a *reduced* risk of heart disease.
Fish farms are equally as cruel as the rest of the meat industry, but we don't relate to them as much so they don't tug on our morals.

Certainly, you can still be healthy with alternative diets.
However, you have to curate your diet much more if you do not include meat. I'm not convinced that an equally curated diet including meat would not be healthier.
