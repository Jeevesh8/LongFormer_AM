The options are as follows
1. You don't agree with what is going on and stop supporting it.
2. You don't care about animals, so you're content with paying for them to be abused for your pleasure.
3. You don't agree with what is going on, but try to put it to the back of your mind and continue to support it.
I suspect this way of looking at it is still somewhat simplistic however
