In high school, I thought I was "good at math" as I'm the son of a math teacher and electrical engineer.
In college, I learned that math was not something you're "good at" but something you have to put hard work into and is almost the sole determiner in the level of skill you obtain.

So then isn't almost any compliment almost to be expected? I've spent a lot of time with similar problems -- how could I not know all the details and little tricks of these problems?

I feel a compliment recognizes something given: I feel everyone is passionate about something, whether it be math or psychology or medicine (I don't hear "you're so good at biology" but I think I should).
