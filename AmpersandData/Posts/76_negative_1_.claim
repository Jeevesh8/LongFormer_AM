There is a 4th choice.
despite how much you love your dog
your farmed tilapia doesn't have the cognition to question whether it's life is worth living.
I want the animals to be raised humanely
I want them to be killed humanely
No, it thinks more "food? sex? food?".
The best they can manage is "Fence. Bad."
It doesn't make it a better of worse life - it's just existing.
That's the other choice - accepting that animals are less than humans.
