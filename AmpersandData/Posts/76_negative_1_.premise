it's not like a wild turkey sits on it's deathbed and thinks fondly of those days gone by, when it roamed free and raised its baby turkeys.
Yes, they feel pain, but so does an earthworm, if you mean "experience messages that say 'bad things are happening - endeavor to stop them'".
They don't look back and say, "Man, remember when I bumped into that electric fence?
That hurt like hell."
There is no "meaningful" or "meaningless" life for an animal - they don't philosophize beyond needs.
Most farm animals spend less time hungry, scratched by brambles, running from predators, etc than wild animals.
