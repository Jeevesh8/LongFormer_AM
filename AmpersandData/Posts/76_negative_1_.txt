There is a 4th choice.
You can choose to not anthropomorphize animals, and, despite how much you love your dog, realize that a chicken is just a chicken, and that your farmed tilapia doesn't have the cognition to question whether it's life is worth living.

I want the animals to be raised humanely, and, yes, I want them to be killed humanely.
But it's not like a wild turkey sits on it's deathbed and thinks fondly of those days gone by, when it roamed free and raised its baby turkeys.
No, it thinks more "food? sex? food?".

Yes, they feel pain, but so does an earthworm, if you mean "experience messages that say 'bad things are happening - endeavor to stop them'".
They don't look back and say, "Man, remember when I bumped into that electric fence?
That hurt like hell."
The best they can manage is "Fence. Bad."

There is no "meaningful" or "meaningless" life for an animal - they don't philosophize beyond needs.
Most farm animals spend less time hungry, scratched by brambles, running from predators, etc than wild animals.
It doesn't make it a better of worse life - it's just existing.
That's the other choice - accepting that animals are less than humans.
