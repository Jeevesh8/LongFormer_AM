A chicken feels pain and suffering and does not want to feel those things as much as we do.
My sister is severely mentally disabled and most likely doesn't have the capacity to think fondly of days gone by on her death bed either.
I still don't see any good argument for how animals are 'less' than humans (beyond our own obvious bias).
