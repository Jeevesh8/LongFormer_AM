&gt;a chicken is just a chicken

A chicken feels pain and suffering and does not want to feel those things as much as we do.

&gt;But it's not like a wild turkey sits on it's deathbed and thinks fondly of those days gone by, when it roamed free and raised its baby turkeys. No, it thinks more "food? sex? food?".

My sister is severely mentally disabled and most likely doesn't have the capacity to think fondly of days gone by on her death bed either.
Does intelligence really make much of a difference when it comes to the ethics of whether we can kill them without moral concern?

I still don't see any good argument for how animals are 'less' than humans (beyond our own obvious bias).
