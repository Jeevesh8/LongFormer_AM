How does a chicken "want" anything?
It is completely incapable of developing a though like, "Today would REALLY suck if that damn fox bites me again".

Yes, intelligence matters.
If not, we wouldn't allow brain-dead people to be unplugged.
Self-awareness puts one in a separate category than an animal.
But, regardless, I'm not trying to convince you not to care about animals, but that a rational person could come to the decision that those without higher cognition or self-awareness aren't equal.
