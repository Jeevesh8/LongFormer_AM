Most people aren't paid on commission
you're neglecting the janitor who is necessary to keep the factory functioning (and presumably gets paid) but doesn't "produce" anything.
when this system scales up you need to include the boss buying things.
whatever profit the boss makes goes back into the system as they spend money
This value may not be the price being charged for the thing
sometimes (or a lot of the time) the boss just hoards their extra money and doesn't re-inject it
it won't sell and will be waste
the seller overpriced it
not because it was doomed to be waste as soon as it was made.
you mean to say that real-life capitalism is inefficient
