&gt; The boss pays each of her workers Â£5 for each doll that the worker produces

Most people aren't paid on commission, so this isn't really a good example, but I think I get where you're going with it.

&gt;if each worker is being paid less than the price of the things they produce

But the money doesn't just disappear.
For one thing, you're neglecting the janitor who is necessary to keep the factory functioning (and presumably gets paid) but doesn't "produce" anything.
You're also neglecting that when this system scales up you need to include the boss buying things.

Since whatever profit the boss makes goes back into the system as they spend money, there should be at all times enough money in the system to cover the value of what it produced.
This value may not be the price being charged for the thing, and that's where supply and demand are involved.

I'm not going to deny that sometimes (or a lot of the time) the boss just hoards their extra money and doesn't re-inject it, but that's more a failure of the system than the system itself.
The same goes for when something is priced above its market value, it won't sell and will be waste, but that's because the seller overpriced it, not because it was doomed to be waste as soon as it was made.

No ideal system is really going to be inefficient, its the real ones that have problems.

If you mean to say that real-life capitalism is inefficient, then no one is going to dispute you, but I will point out that it's the most efficient real system we have.
