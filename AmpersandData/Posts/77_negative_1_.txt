Option 3.1415926: I buy all my meat from local farms that I know have free-range chickens and cows that are grass-fed and well-treated until they are humanely slaughtered, and once the technology exists to 3D-print a chicken breast that tastes about as good as the real thing at an affordable price with 0 animal death, I eat that instead.
