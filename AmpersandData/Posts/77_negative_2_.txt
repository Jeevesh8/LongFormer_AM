I personally don't see any distinction between my pet dog and a chicken.
If I had to take my cat to be euthanised at the vet, I would never consider his throat being sliced by a machine as he hung upside down as humane treatment.
Probably not even a bolt to the brain either.

I agree that synthetic meat would be absolutely amazing though!
