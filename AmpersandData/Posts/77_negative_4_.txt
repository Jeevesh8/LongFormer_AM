I may have a different stance on seeing no difference between companion animals and farm animals because many of my pets are exotic and farm animals.
The fact we have domesticated some animals also does not mean they suffer any differently to their wild cousins.
Are you seriously saying you consider slaughtering an animal morally equal to harvesting a crop?
