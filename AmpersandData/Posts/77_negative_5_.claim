I consider my 1 chicken/2 days to be morally equivalent to the 8 heads of lettuce/day it would take me to get the same basic caloric intake (note: I don't have any real accuracy for the amount per day, just a rough guesstimation) to be about morally equal.
A sheep with a shepherd is many times less likely to have its throat ripped out by a wolf and having its last experience on earth be something as gruesome as the beginnings of being eaten.
there is nothing past that instant
at the very least we are less vicious than other predators in that we wait until the animal is definitely dead before we start eating it
I'm not arguing that death at the hands of humans is better than living on
living on is better than just about any death
I'm arguing that of the potential ways to die, being killed is the best an animal can realistically hope for
