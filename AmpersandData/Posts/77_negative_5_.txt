In a day, I eat maybe 1/3 of a cow or 1/2 of a chicken if I'm hungry
If I were eating veggies, I'd consume several plants.
I consider my 1 chicken/2 days to be morally equivalent to the 8 heads of lettuce/day it would take me to get the same basic caloric intake (note: I don't have any real accuracy for the amount per day, just a rough guesstimation) to be about morally equal.

&gt;The fact we have domesticated some animals also does not mean they suffer any differently to their wild cousins.

On the contrary: A sheep with a shepherd is many times less likely to have its throat ripped out by a wolf and having its last experience on earth be something as gruesome as the beginnings of being eaten.
A bolt to the brain sounds bad, but there is nothing past that instant.
No pain, no awareness, just cessation of life.
Ditto that for every other domestic food animal, and even animals that we hunt for food: at the very least we are less vicious than other predators in that we wait until the animal is definitely dead before we start eating it.

I'm not arguing that death at the hands of humans is better than living on; in the general sense, living on is better than just about any death; I'm arguing that of the potential ways to die, being killed is the best an animal can realistically hope for.
