Good point, although I regard that as speciesism.

I do have a Christian friend who is extremely charitable.
She's a carer, a foster mother and a complete romantic who writes novels about angels.
She 's obviously an all-round good and kind person, but she eats meat.

I rationalise this by realising that helping people is her passion, and perhaps her religion justifies a moral distinction between humans and non-human animals.
Doesn't the Bible claim something along the lines of that animals were created for the enjoyment of humans (I haven't read it myself)?
