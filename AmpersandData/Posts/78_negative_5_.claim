I think it's fairly normal to be a speciesist.
I'm not trying to argue from a point of naturalism in regards to what ought to be done
it shouldn't be that surprising when we encounter people that are that way
it's hard enough for many people to empathize with *each other*
It's just beyond the scope for many people
the bible states that all animals were put on earth by God to serve man
There were rules against eating certain kinds
overall the idea was that humans have dominion over all
there is no cognitive dissonance
this would probably fall under your 2nd line of reasoning
