I think it's fairly normal to be a speciesist.
I want to make note that I'm not trying to argue from a point of naturalism in regards to what ought to be done, but that it shouldn't be that surprising when we encounter people that are that way.

I mean hell, it's hard enough for many people to empathize with *each other*, and you're asking them to try to put themselves in the hooves of a cow?
It's just beyond the scope for many people unless they seriously put the time in to think about it, and they've got their own lives to worry about.

To address your last question, yes, the bible states that all animals were put on earth by God to serve man.
There were rules against eating certain kinds, but overall the idea was that humans have dominion over all.
In which case, there is no cognitive dissonance, but this would probably fall under your 2nd line of reasoning.
