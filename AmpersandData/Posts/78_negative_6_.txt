&gt;I think it's fairly normal to be a speciesist. I want to make note that I'm not trying to argue from a point of naturalism in regards to what ought to be done, but that it shouldn't be that surprising when we encounter people that are that way.

Yes, speciesism is indeed the norm and I appreciate you taking the time to comment.
I asked this question so as to keep myself grounded in what other justifications my loved ones around me didn't have the same epiphany I did (as it may not necessary be the same reasons I had for not going vegan sooner).

&gt;I mean hell, it's hard enough for many people to empathize with each other, and you're asking them to try to put themselves in the hooves of a cow? It's just beyond the scope for many people unless they seriously put the time in to think about it, and they've got their own lives to worry about.

A very good reminder, thank you.
Not everyone is as obsessed with philosophy, psychology and nature as I am, just as I don't concern myself with keeping extremely up to date on world politics and Amnesty International petitions.

I'd still class it as option 3 though :P
