Maybe it has to do with being an adolescent and being new to dealing with the opposite sex
I'm beginning to fall under the assumption that the only purpose for guys to get to know girls is to eventually engage in romance.
my perception might just be distorted after reading Neil Strauss's *The Game*
the above questions are more like fragments of a bigger picture of misunderstanding
It also must distort my view to have gone to an all-boy's school for the majority of my life.
I feel like the interplay between men and women is always (at least always initially) a bs game
I can't stand it
