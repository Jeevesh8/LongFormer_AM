this has never remotely seemed the case from my perspective as a lesbian
there are many people who want close relationships without romance
maybe you're right
people are different from you
relationships are hard to compare
Sexual attraction is not something that just shuts off
Thats just reality for most people
its not necesarily harmful and its not really shallow.
There are very few absolutes when it comes to interpersonal relationships.
