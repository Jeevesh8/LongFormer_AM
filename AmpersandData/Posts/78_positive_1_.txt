Id just like to point out that this has never remotely seemed the case from my perspective as a lesbian.
Beyond that, there are many people who want close relationships without romance, an obvious example would be asexual people.
They can have close relationships that rival that of marriage, but how would you even quantify that?
How can you even compare them?
What about the relationship of a brother and sister?

If you limit it to just heterosexual non-related men and women, then maybe you're right, but then again who is to say what form of relationship is the highest, two very close lifetime friends who are platonic or a married couple?

The bottom line is that people are different from you can relationships are hard to compare.
Maybe for you, every relationship with a woman is motivated by romance.
For someone other hetero guy it might not be.
Sexual attraction is not something that just shuts off so even if you're in a lifelong comitted closed relationship you'll still probably feel attraction for other people.
Thats just reality for most people, and its not necesarily harmful and its not really shallow.

There are very few absolutes when it comes to interpersonal relationships.
