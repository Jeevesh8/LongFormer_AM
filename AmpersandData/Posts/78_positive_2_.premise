I don't need to feel guilty when I'm attracted to people I know I can't have?
When I said highest, I meant it not from a perspective of quantity of some sort
a level of worth
who is to put a romantic relationship above a friendship?
It's a bit extreme and morbid
if I were to put someone's spouse and someone's absolute best friend in front of a train and gave that person one to save, whom would they save?
once I reach a certain threshold with a guy-friend, I find that we become best friends
when I reach that threshold with a girl-friend, I find that I want more
I haven't been around the block enough or had enough female friends to feel this way
I don't have any lesbian friends (as far as I know at least)
