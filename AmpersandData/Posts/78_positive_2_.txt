In short, I don't need to feel guilty when I'm attracted to people I know I can't have?
Maybe I'm too black-and-white to think that the murmurs of my id are natural and not evil.

As for which relationship is *higher* from a quantifiable standpoint, I see what you mean.
When I said highest, I meant it not from a perspective of quantity of some sort, but of a level of worth.
Looking at that statement, however, I think you're right again--who is to put a romantic relationship above a friendship?

It's a bit extreme and morbid, but if I were to put someone's spouse and someone's absolute best friend in front of a train and gave that person one to save, whom would they save?
Maybe I just find that once I reach a certain threshold with a guy-friend, I find that we become best friends, but when I reach that threshold with a girl-friend, I find that I want more.
Maybe I haven't been around the block enough or had enough female friends to feel this way.
I don't have any lesbian friends (as far as I know at least), so I don't know how I would react to being great friends with one.
