i'm emotionally retarded, and instead of giving into my nature and letting my thought process be masturbated from a more standard answer, you're subjecting me to therapy by trying to illustrate that such views are had by inferior humans
These illustrations very clearly show that you are attempting for me to change my view based on your argument that I am inferior
As for your concluding paragraph, it is complete nonsense
I don't know where in this thread that I was *very confident* in my views
Really, your argument is absolutely ludacris
I think not! you need to expand your perspective to not even consider such things!
Its rather ironic that you are peddling how emotionally retarded I am
