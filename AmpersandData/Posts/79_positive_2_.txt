This is a great way to look at it. I come from this all-boy's school background, and I can't shake the feeling of loss when a male friend of mine gets together with a female friend.
I feel like I'm impinging on their relationship whenever I try to interact with the girl because I'm afraid that my male friend will think that there's some ulterior motive involved.

What all of you seem to be telling me so far is that the highest form of relationship doesn't have to be romantic, yet for some reason I wonder how you've make such good friends and been able to keep it fully platonic with all of them.
I hope that's not a bad thing to wonder--I just thought that if you get that close with someone, they might be for you.
