I've always had a respect for the men in uniform and I've always wanted to join.
Recently I've disagreed with the practices of the U.S. military
The only reservation that I had was that it would be a waste of my time
I love the idea of a brotherhood but I don't agree with the ideology,
the military putting me through Med school will help me jump start life,
I'm very inexperienced and haven't seen much of the world and this I think will help me
