&gt; Something in the ballpark of 45% of women who have abortions have more than one abortion. These people would have been raised by their incompetent parents to drain down society, increase crime rates, suck up resources, and generally screw things up.
What are you talking about?
Do you really think abortions are only had by incompetent people who couldn't be good parents?
This appears to be a belief that has led you to conclude that America must be better off but you are really misinformed about the type of women who obtain abortions.
