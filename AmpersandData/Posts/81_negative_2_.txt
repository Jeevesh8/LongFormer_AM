That may be true.
My thinking was that abortions were mainly required by unfortunate people, who in turn from their difficult circumstances, would've raised the child to be the same.
Can you counter that? I have a [source](http://www.guttmacher.org/media/nr/2010/05/04/index.html) that shows that abortions are typically (and in some years, mostly) had by people without enough wealth to care for there kids.
