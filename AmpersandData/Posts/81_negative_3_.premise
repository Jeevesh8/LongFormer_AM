Some stats for example include "31% of women obtaining abortions are in school; 68% of women who have abortions are employed."
"33% of women who obtain abortions have family incomes under $11,000 annually, 11% of abortions are obtained by women whose household incomes are $50,000 or more."
that means the majority of those having abortions have income between $11,000 and $55,000, which is above the Federal Poverty line.
It could be about finances but could just be too soon for a woman to go through again.
Pregnancy is hard on the body and far riskier than an abortion performed within a few weeks.
