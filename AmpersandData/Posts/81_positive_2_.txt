Hmm... I understand your point.
And your explanation on why the series' games are extremely similar to each other is superb.
However, this in itself isn't why I think the games are overrated.
Many other game serie use a formulaic system for their games that renders them very similar to each other, such as Assassin's Creed, or Pokemon.
The thing about CoD that really makes it an overrated series is that it is very similar to other FPS games, such as Battlefield.
It really doesn't have any revolutionary groundbreaking features of its own, and each game feeds off the success of its predecessor.
