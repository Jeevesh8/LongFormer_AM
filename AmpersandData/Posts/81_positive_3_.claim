One can argue some earlier games like Counterstrike did something similar much sooner, for some reason CoD popularized it.
Brought it to the mainstream.
It's not so much that CoD is similar to other FPS as other FPSs largely copied their model.
It's the copies and general state of the genre today that is overrated and hackneyed.
I feel that your view isn't so much feeling that CoD is overrated as it is that you feel multiplayer FPS is overrated.
