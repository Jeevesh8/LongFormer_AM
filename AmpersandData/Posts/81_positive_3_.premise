It was the first FPS to really popularize the RPG elements of progression and grow multiplayer FPS to the size that it is.
Halo may have been the first of its kind at the time, but CoD created a very effective system where you leveled up, unlocked new guns, and gave you customization in your load out.
When considering the first few CoDs, this was massive and largely is attributed to its success.
It turned multiplayer FPS from a niche genre to if not the largest genre.
Hell, consider Halo 4 that changed their fundamental mechanics to match more of a CoD pace and include load outs and level progression.
It's a large statement that such a dedicated fanbase Halo had moved toward the direction of CoD. Given CoD's immense popularity, everyone wanted to jump on the bandwagon of its success.
To view CoD as overrated for being the series that really grew the genre to what it is today would be to say WoW is overrated given how many MMOs are similar.
 When you consider there were a select few MMOs before WoW that failed to mainstream and popularize the genre, and the immense number of WoW clones after its success, it's not fair to say WoW is overrated.
It's iconic in its genre.
