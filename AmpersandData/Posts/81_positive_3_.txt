Then to that, the only thing I can offer is the historical context of CoD. It was the first FPS to really popularize the RPG elements of progression and grow multiplayer FPS to the size that it is.
Halo may have been the first of its kind at the time, but CoD created a very effective system where you leveled up, unlocked new guns, and gave you customization in your load out.
When considering the first few CoDs, this was massive and largely is attributed to its success.
It turned multiplayer FPS from a niche genre to if not the largest genre.
One can argue some earlier games like Counterstrike did something similar much sooner, for some reason CoD popularized it.
Brought it to the mainstream.

It's not so much that CoD is similar to other FPS as other FPSs largely copied their model.
Hell, consider Halo 4 that changed their fundamental mechanics to match more of a CoD pace and include load outs and level progression.
It's a large statement that such a dedicated fanbase Halo had moved toward the direction of CoD. Given CoD's immense popularity, everyone wanted to jump on the bandwagon of its success.

To view CoD as overrated for being the series that really grew the genre to what it is today would be to say WoW is overrated given how many MMOs are similar.
 When you consider there were a select few MMOs before WoW that failed to mainstream and popularize the genre, and the immense number of WoW clones after its success, it's not fair to say WoW is overrated.
It's iconic in its genre.
It's the copies and general state of the genre today that is overrated and hackneyed.

Same with CoD. I feel that your view isn't so much feeling that CoD is overrated as it is that you feel multiplayer FPS is overrated.
