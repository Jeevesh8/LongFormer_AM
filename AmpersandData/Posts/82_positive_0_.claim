I am not saying that people are not allowed to do what they like.
Also, I don't mean to suggest that there is anything wrong with posting nudes.
Lastly, I have nothing wrong with nudity and am in fact a fan of nudity, I just don't understand exposing yourself to the entirety of the internet on a whim.
Whenever I see anyone, male or female, posting nude pictures on the internet, I immediately assume that they are somehow seeking attention.
Of course, that's the point, but I think that it must stem from some underlying need to get attention that they must either be lacking in some other part of their life
