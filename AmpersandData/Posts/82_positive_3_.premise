Do you do this to seek attention from her?
Or do you do it because it is empowering?
It makes you feel good when she tells you how impressed she is with your junk and when she gets pleasure from it.
Other people don't have partners to do this with so they resort to the internet.
Some people even have partners and still do it.
It's a thrill and a risk that gives people immense pleasure.
They are not getting any attention though, since they usually remain anonymous.
Also, when it is spread online you hardly ever find out who has seen it or what people think of it.
Therefore, you may never be able to recognize the attention you get.
Just the act of posting the photo is enough to drive some people wild, whether 1 person sees it or 1,000.
