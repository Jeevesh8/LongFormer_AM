Like I've said, isn't the garnering of any attention on the internet from your nudes photos still seeking the attention of others?
It doesn't matter how many strangers see it, just the fact that they are strangers.
I think the anonymity of the internet allows people to freely get the attention without worrying about the recognition or views of friends and family, so they're purposely looking for attention they can't find within their immediate relationships.
