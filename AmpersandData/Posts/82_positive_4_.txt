I want to show them to my girlfriend because I know that it makes her think of our sexual activities and I'm trying to make her think about that to remind her off how it feels good physically and to be close with her in a sexual way.
I don't do it to bring attention to myself, but rather to our relationship.
This is much different from posting a photo that a tension stranger will masturbate to.

Like I've said, isn't the garnering of any attention on the internet from your nudes photos still seeking the attention of others?
It doesn't matter how many strangers see it, just the fact that they are strangers.
I think the anonymity of the internet allows people to freely get the attention without worrying about the recognition or views of friends and family, so they're purposely looking for attention they can't find within their immediate relationships.
