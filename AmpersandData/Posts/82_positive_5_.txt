You do it because you get pleasure from your girlfriend being into you and your sexual relationship.
This is empowering, not attention seeking.
Other people do it because they get pleasure from strangers masturbating to it.
This is empowering, not attention seeking.
Just because you don't find it empowering to post nudes, doesn't mean other people won't.
It's impossible to assert that everyone who has posted nudes does it strictly for attention.
Similarly, I have sent photos of this nature to various girls who I was not dating.
However, I have never posted nudes online.
I'm somewhere in between this spectrum.
I can guarantee you I was not trying to get attention from these girls, and nor was I trying to make them think of our sexual activities or remind them of sex (impossible since I didn't live near them).
I enjoyed their compliments, knowing that they received pleasure, and seeing their photos as well.
Sexting is an entirely separate entity that has it's own set of motivations.
