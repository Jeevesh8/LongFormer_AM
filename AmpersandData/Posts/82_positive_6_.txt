I guess a big issue that others here have pointed out is my distinction between empowering and attention seeking.
I just don't understand that you're of behavior and since I have never partaken in it I just can't grasp it.
The trouble I have is that I don't get a good enough perspective from those that do post nudes online.
You're right about the sexting thing, and that's where, as I stated in another comment, the fine line ice drawn is hard to find and relatively ambiguous.
Of course, I have no issue with sexting, considering I do it often, so I guess in that sense I can sort of understand the stance one would receive from posting nudes.
