Just as I don't necessarily understand the joy of exhibitionism, exhibitionists don't understand how I *don't* find joy from it.
Since I am so unaccustomed to it and do not partake in it, I can't make an uninformed judgement about it.
I am not going to tell that person that he/she is doing it for attention - because frankly - I have no clue why exactly the person does it (the person may not even know either)!
