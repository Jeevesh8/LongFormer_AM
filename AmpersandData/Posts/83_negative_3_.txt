partly, but communism in combination with capitalism has a different approach then pure communism, one of the failures of communism was the lack of incentive, with a part capitalism those with drive can still succeed, but everyone else will still have basic living tools,
and i won't lie, people will see a reduction in what they are able to buy, but when you balance that out with perpetual unemployment its still better then the alternative.
ps
Communism has some flaws , but it has also had a long time for people to find solutions to those flaws,
