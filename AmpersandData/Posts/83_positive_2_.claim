I personally am against the openness that society has taken with the internet
.
I think that this openness is not detrimental per se, but is just a display of someone's character.
Like I said, I have no*problem* with anyone posting nudes,
I just immediately view them differently as one seeking attention.
When I see that type of situation I see someone who knowingly is attractive, considering they have a high status, and is willing to sexually pleasure their followers via this attractiveness that they already know they have.
I as a person have a hard time seeing through other people's eyes if I can't justify a logical reason to do it.
I just don't see any reason in this type of behavior.
