There are plenty of other ways to garner positive attention that everyone can agree is positive, instead of morally questionable behavior.
Also, why is gaining a celebrity status for something like posting nudes empowering?
What about that makes someone feel good?
Also, I think that some of my problem is, like you said, the fine line I have drawn.
The lines I tend to draw in life are ambiguous and hard to support which often results in a weak basis for my opinions.
Hence, my seeking of others opinions.
