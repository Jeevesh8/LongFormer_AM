I personally am against the openness that society has taken with the internet
. I do not participate in most social media besides reddit, and even then I mostly lurk.
Regardless, I think that this openness is not detrimental per se, but is just a display of someone's character.
Like I said, I have no*problem* with anyone posting nudes, I just immediately view them differently as one seeking attention.
There are plenty of other ways to garner positive attention that everyone can agree is positive, instead of morally questionable behavior.
Of course no harm is done, but often this type of behavior CAN come back to haunt the original poster in a number of ways.

Also, why is gaining a celebrity status for something like posting nudes empowering?
What about that makes someone feel good?
When I see that type of situation I see someone who knowingly is attractive, considering they have a high status, and is willing to sexually pleasure their followers via this attractiveness that they already know they have.

I understand that a lot of the issues I raise are personal opinions not shared by others which is why I asked in the first place.
I as a person have a hard time seeing through other people's eyes if I can't justify a logical reason to do it.
I just don't see any reason in this type of behavior.
Also, I think that some of my problem is, like you said, the fine line I have drawn.
The lines I tend to draw in life are ambiguous and hard to support which often results in a weak basis for my opinions.
Hence, my seeking of others opinions.
Thanks for your reply.
