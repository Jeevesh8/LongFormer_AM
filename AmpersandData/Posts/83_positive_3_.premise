Let us not forget that during the Renaissance there was a huge movement for the exploration of the human form as a work of art.
Much of the surviving ancient sculptures and paintings show the nakedness of the human form, and this art compares us to heroes and gods as did much of the writing and philosophy of the time as we tried to figure out our "meaning" in the universe.
What makes modern sexuality morally abhorrent?
What logical basis is there for the rejection of the human form and the demonizing those who are open about their sexual identity?
Slut shaming, or as you did, calling it as "whoring"?
the basis of that has been our periodic pushes from the church, periods of "Great Awakening" where fundamentalists have tried to restore us to some kind of repressive god-fearing and internalized state of self loathing and cleansing for sin.
In fact if you look towards Europe, a lot of their media is much more lenient on sex than violence, whereas over here we're more lenient on violence than sex.
The only ways I can think of are people trying to go back and find those pictures and use them against a person as some kind of ad-hominem attack in the public.
Even you've admitted you can't really articulate it you just feel this way because you *just do*. Which is no basis for a logical or reasonable way to think about the world.
