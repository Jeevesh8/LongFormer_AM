I'm not going to challenge your view that networking is unfair, because it totally is.
But I am going to challenge your view that it should be discouraged or eliminated.
There are some exceptions, that justify regulation, such as environmental or fraud protection,
I don't think networking is one of them,
 The best way to do that is to hire people you've worked with before, and you know are good, or people your colleagues and friends have worked with before, who you trust when they say that someone is good.
