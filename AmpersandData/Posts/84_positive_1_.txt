I'm not going to challenge your view that networking is unfair, because it totally is.
But I am going to challenge your view that it should be discouraged or eliminated.

 Businesses are and should be designed to be effective.
Being fair is, at best, a secondary goal.
Any company/society which encourages business practices that are not effective will quickly be out-competed by one that is effective, and having effective businesses in a society in general improves the quality of life of the people living there.
There are some exceptions, that justify regulation, such as environmental or fraud protection, but I don't think networking is one of them, the reason being just how expensive it is to find employees without using networking.
Simply getting an employee in the door often costs about 1 years worth of their salary, with that money going to the recruiters that found the person, paying people to review their resume, interview them, do background checks, etc.
Then, after they start working, they have to be trained, and get up to speed on their new job, which (depending on the job) can often take months.
If all of this time and money goes towards a bad hire, that is an extremely bad thing for the business, which means that it's extremely important to minimize the number of bad hires.
 The best way to do that is to hire people you've worked with before, and you know are good, or people your colleagues and friends have worked with before, who you trust when they say that someone is good.
Interviews are an extremely poor replacement actually working with someone, or for the opinion of a trusted colleague.
