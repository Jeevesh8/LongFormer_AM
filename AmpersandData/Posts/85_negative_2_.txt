The reason that the end of our current economic paradigm won't be followed by a new one is because there is nothing for us to do after the machines are doing all of the service jobs we are currently losing.
Machines don't have money either so they won't bother buying services from us.
Cryptocurrency may help a little because it would allow servers to be able to buy and sell things, but once they can administrate their own systems what is the use of humans.
What would be stopping them is the people already in the commutes they would try to go to.
If the urban folk get rid of the rural folk the urban folk will just die due to their lack of skills.
They couldn't just survive together because the ecosystem will not be able to sustain the amount of people.
The rural folk can survive without the urban folk but their standard of living will plummet due to lack of infrastructure.
