Society might collapse, lots of people may starve/die in struggle for survival, but extinction of a whole species seems highly unlikely.
I don;t think it would devolve into a pure hunter gatherer society (maybe a bit at first)
once the dust settles it would probably stabilize at a preindustrial agricultural society
