Society might collapse, lots of people may starve/die in struggle for survival, but extinction of a whole species seems highly unlikely.
We're not dependent on our technology to survive.
There's lots of open country and unspoiled/airable farmland.
Lots of people today live subsistence off the grid throughout the world.
I don;t think it would devolve into a pure hunter gatherer society (maybe a bit at first) but once the dust settles it would probably stabilize at a preindustrial agricultural society.
People are smart, printed books still exist, where the average group of city slickers could get enough knowledge to plant some crops and survive off the land.
