Ive seen a lot of animated movies in my life but in my opinion they dont stand up to the Brave Little Toaster.
I feel like this masterpiece is largely unappreciated by a majority of people in favor of other animated movies.
Reddit I think the Brave Little Toaster needs some more attention and some more love.
