The Brave Little Toaster is rated "Fresh" on Rotten Tomatoes, and came fairly close to winning the Sundance Film Festival in 1987.
The movie was not widely released in theaters because they never found a distributor for it.
So most of us who saw it did so in comparatively limited TV showings, or picked up a VHS tape.
It wasn't a made for TV movie, but that's what ended up happening to it.
It has massively outsized footprint for how easy it is to find and view.
Those who worked on it went on to do great things, and those who stumbled across it remember it.
but it is obscure and can be a hard sell because key elements haven't aged well.
