Holy Crap I never knew it only went straight to VHS.
That does explain a lot which kinda makes me sad it never got the loving from a massive portion of people like Iron Giant.
Maybe a rerelease on Netflix will reignite the fire of the Brave Little Toaster.

btw Um you get a delta for proving me wrong and that the movie was loved by the people but had very little in terms of distribution &#8710;
