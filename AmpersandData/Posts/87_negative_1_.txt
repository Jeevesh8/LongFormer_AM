Vegans decide not to eat meat because they want to make a statement about something they believe in, not necessarily because they want to improve animal welfare.
(although they likely do want to improve animal welfare) Let me explain:

As you already pointed out, becoming a vegan has little to no affect on animal welfare.
People will always want meat and the market will always provide it.
Vegan that truly believes that they are directly helping animals by not eating meat are deluding themselves.
You are correct on this point.

So why do vegans decide to be vegans, if not to directly help animals?

Most vegans eat their burgers without beef because they want to make a statement. "
I believe that animals are being treated cruelly. because of this, I will not eat meat."
It's a bit like not going to a restaurant because they came out against a belief of yours.
If you believe in gay rights, you may decide not to go to chick-fil-a because of your belief.
Do you really believe that you not giving business will help in any way?

no, you don't.
You just want to make a statement.

TL;DR:  You are correct,  but  you misinterpret the true motivation of vegans 

Hope that helps.
