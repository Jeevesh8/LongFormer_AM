&gt; I don't think I'm misinterpreting the motivations of vegans.

Your OP implied that you thought the purpose of veganism is was to improve animal welfare.
Forgive me if I misinterpreted you.

&gt; that people go vegan/vegetarian for a huge variety of reasons, from personal health to carbon footprint to animal welfare to ethics of eating meat to budget (meat is expensive).

Yes, these are all other reasons that people go into veganism.
However, since (I thought) your post pertained to the "Vegans are vegans because they hate the state of animal welfare," reasoning, I made my post primarily about the relationship between vegans and animal welfare.
