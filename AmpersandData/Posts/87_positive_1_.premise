This just won't help the situation in any way.
Neither things are as cool as fighting Russians out of a moral sense of duty, but they're far more effective.
You should not underestimate how threatened Russia feels by the West's expansion into what used to be a buffer zone.
Whether that feeling and their reaction are justified or not doesn't really matter; the fact is that a proxy war between Europe and Russia would be disastrous.
