I doubt anyone on the Ukrainian front actually wants a bunch of untrained Europeans to show up and start attacking anything that looks vaguely Russian.
This just won't help the situation in any way.
If you really want to help, sending money you earn with something you're actually good at (your job) is far more helpful.
Another thing you can do is to tell your government to send (military) aid.
Neither things are as cool as fighting Russians out of a moral sense of duty, but they're far more effective.

The above assumes that the Europeans should get more involved with the Ukrainian conflict.
While I agree that that might be the moral thing to do, we should be very careful not to escalate the conflict.
You should not underestimate how threatened Russia feels by the West's expansion into what used to be a buffer zone.
Whether that feeling and their reaction are justified or not doesn't really matter; the fact is that a proxy war between Europe and Russia would be disastrous.
