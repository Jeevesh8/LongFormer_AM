Telling my government to send help is easier said than done.
Not everybody will make enough that his financial support will outweigh the military support he can provide, this is a definite nuance to my general initial statement though.
Supporting foreign militaries financially also has proven sketchy at best in the past, because it's hard to control where the weapons eventually end up.
Putin knows very well that he's transgressing.
If that's quelled quickly and effectively, things will get back to normal, whereas if he gets away with it, he might push and push to see how far he can go.
