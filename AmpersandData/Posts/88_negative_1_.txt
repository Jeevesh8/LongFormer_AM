A lot (dunno %) vegetarians/vegans see killing animals for food is fundamentally unethical.
So they are not doing it for better state of animal welfare in farms.
I personally don't have a problem with animals being killed humanely, so if I become vegetarian it would be about welfare.
But that's me.
But I agree with you that becoming vegetarian just for that is not very helpful for welfare.
I just see people's reasoning.
