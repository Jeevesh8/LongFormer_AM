Christianity was primarily spread by the Roman empire.
But Rome already had a state religion before it adopted Christianity.
So the victory of Christianity over the Roman version of Hellenism can't be attributed to geography alone.

Likewise, Islam was hardly the first religion that Arabia had seen.
Its dominance there was not mere geography.
