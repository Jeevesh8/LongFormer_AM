I'm definitely intrigued by this, but not quite convinced enough to delta
. I might be able to go to "The religion eventually adopted by the Roman empire had a very good chance of becoming globally dominant", but I think that's still largely an accident of geography, and your post definitely didn't address my point A) about a hypothetical identical religion in a different location.

Do you have any thoughts on, if not geography, why the abrahamic religions have become so widespread while other religions have not?
