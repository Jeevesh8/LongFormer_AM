 Are you suggesting that INCREASING the number of weapons would decrease the lethal use of those weapons? 
 It MIGHT help mitigate one instance of shootings, like today's in Paris 
 surely tempt or instigate more occurrences in its place as the weapons are that much easier to access and use? 
 This seems like a very difficult thing to prove or disprove either way because of the lack of research 
 I'm loathed to suggest increasing gun ownership could be a possible solution 
 Surely, LESS would be better?
