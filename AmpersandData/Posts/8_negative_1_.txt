 Are you suggesting that INCREASING the number of weapons would decrease the lethal use of those weapons?  
 It MIGHT help mitigate one instance of shootings, like today's in Paris , but  surely tempt or instigate more occurrences in its place as the weapons are that much easier to access and use?  
 If increasing gun ownership would benefit society, would there be a point where if X number of people owned and carried a gun, there would be no shootings at all?  
 How do the stats stack up in support of your view? 

 This seems like a very difficult thing to prove or disprove either way because of the lack of research , but  I'm loathed to suggest increasing gun ownership could be a possible solution , because... I dunno,they have a reputation for misuse?  
 Surely, LESS would be better?
