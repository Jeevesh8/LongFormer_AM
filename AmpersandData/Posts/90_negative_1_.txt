I take some issue with assumption #1.
Dramatic societal changes have happened multiple times throughout history.
They are gradual and at times may seem impossible to many, but they do happen.

The larger issue is that you are somehow concluding that someone choosing to go vegan gives more demand to large factory farms.
You are correct that it may reduce the demand for meat from *slightly* less cruel farms, but it also takes demand away from the larger farms.
Going vegan means fewer animals suffer on small farms and fewer animals suffer on factory farms, not that fewer animals suffer on small farms and more animals suffer on factory farms.
