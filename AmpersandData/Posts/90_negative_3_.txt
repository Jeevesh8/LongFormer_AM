&gt; Someone going vegan and someone becoming an ~~ethical~~ *slightly less unethical* carnivore reduce demand for factory-farmed meat by exactly the same amount (1 person). The ~~ethical~~ *slightly less unethical* carnivore just happens to also increase demand for responsibly-grown meat.

I fixed your statement.
Someone who eats "happy" meat isn't helping animals.
They are simply supporting farms that are somewhat less cruel.
