I guess that this comes from my utilitarian-in-most-cases ethics.
I believe that small-medium improvements over large scales, such as an entire market, are better than large improvements at tiny scales.

Moreover, this CMV is not about "veganism and vegetarianism are bad" it's about "eating meat responsibly is better for animal welfare than abstaining from eating meat"
