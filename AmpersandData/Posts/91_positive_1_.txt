Actually, most commentators think they didn't show up for a year or two.
Also, "inn" is arguably a poor translation.
It wasn't a hotel that didn't have room for them.
It was that extended family didn't have a guest room for Joseph's family (perhaps because of the scandalous nature of Mary's pregnancy?).
Them being stuck in a barn has nothing to do with Joseph being cheap and everything to do with his family having poor hospitality.
