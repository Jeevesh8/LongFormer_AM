According to the theory of evolution it makes more sense that the egg preceded the chicken.
Before the chicken there was a similar but different creature.
Let's call it X. 
Its completely arbitrary when the X officially evolved into a chicken, but at some point it does.
An X, not a chicken lays the first chicken egg.
The chicken egg comes before any creature considered a chicken exist.
Am I wrong?

PS I'm playing laser tag soon so I will respond in 20ish minutes.
