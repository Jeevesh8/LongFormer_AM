If we are being really technical, we can confidently say that the egg came first.

The chicken, as far as we know came into existence around [2500-2100 BC.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken#Origins)

Egg bearing animals, however, seem to be [as old as the dinosuars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur_egg)

From this, we can conclude that the egg came first.
^Unless ^you ^are ^talking ^about ^the ^CHICKEN ^egg ^vs ^the ^chicken, ^in ^which ^case ^I ^have ^no ^clue.
