 Traditionally, in medieval Christian art, there is no consideration of time
 One of the reasons the Italian Renaissance was, well, a *renaissance* was because its painters and artists began presenting things in a more realistic way
there is precedent for depicting stories from the Jesus narrative with no consideration for the actual timeline of events
You're interpretting this as if it is meant to show something "as it happened" when art doesn't always work that way
