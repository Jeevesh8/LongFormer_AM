 Traditionally, in medieval Christian art, there is no consideration of time.
In other words, events that happen at different points in the narrative are depicted as occuring side-by-side without consideration for *when* and *where* they actually happened.
For instance, Jesus might be depicted as both a child and an adult in the same image.

 One of the reasons the Italian Renaissance was, well, a *renaissance* was because its painters and artists began presenting things in a more realistic way, like how we might now think of as like a photograph: a specific moment frozen in time.

My point is, there is precedent for depicting stories from the Jesus narrative with no consideration for the actual timeline of events, merely throwing together elements because they are related thematically or tangentially.
You're interpretting this as if it is meant to show something "as it happened" when art doesn't always work that way.
