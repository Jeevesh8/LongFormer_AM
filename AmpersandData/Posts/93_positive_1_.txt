Matthew 2:11

&gt; And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense and myrrh.

When the wise men visited Jesus, it was in a house.
The Nativity scene is about the visit of the shepherds, but the wise men are drawn into the manger scene early because it looks cooler that way.
