If the various artists who contributed to the scene had intended to make Joseph stereotypically Jewish, they would have.
They'd have given him a big hooked nose.
They'd have given him opulent dress while giving Mary or Jesus poorer dress.
Something.

But no: they don't make Joseph look Jewish at all
. If there's anything anti-Semitic going on, it's the near-erasure of Jesus/Mary/Joseph's Jewishness.
The artists aren't focusing on Joseph as a Jew; he's an early Christian to them.

As to why this conflation of two similar events?
That's a pretty common artistic trope.
You say "event X is like event Y, let's put them together".
The visit of the shepherds and the visit of the kings are narratively redundant.
It's just cleaner storytelling to do the mashup.
