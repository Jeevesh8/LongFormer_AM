American patriots have a general mentality against immigration.
I understand why politics use this slogan
I am not blaming the politicians or corporations running ads running these slogans
really it is the citizens that have the belief that they are better, because of the side of a line they are born on, that are at fault
Patriotism is really just this belief.
