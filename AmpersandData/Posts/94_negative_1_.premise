I would define patriotism quite simply as supporting one's country, but not *necessarily* disparaging others.
Someone who attempts to extract gain for themselves at harm to their overall country is acting unpatriotically
someone who assists another country that is in worse shape instead of assisting their own can still be a patriot, but also recognize significant need in other nations and decide to assist them as well
