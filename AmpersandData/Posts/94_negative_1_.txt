I would define patriotism quite simply as supporting one's country, but not *necessarily* disparaging others.
Therefore I would say that the antithesis of patriotism is not having a global perspective, but is in fact selfishness.
Someone who attempts to extract gain for themselves at harm to their overall country is acting unpatriotically, someone who assists another country that is in worse shape instead of assisting their own can still be a patriot, but also recognize significant need in other nations and decide to assist them as well.
Whether you support immigration or not, so long as you are supporting what you believe is best for your nation, you are still acting patriotically, and even if you decide to support another nation you can still be acting patriotically as well so long as you support your nation too.
