Good arguments.
Although I may disagree somewhat, I see why censorship can be dangerous.
One thing about censorship : don't you think it's a problem that the likes of ISIS some neo-nazi groups actively recruit on twitter and facebook ? Should't this sort of thing be stopped ?

&gt; There are many things we used to consider extreme that are now fundamental principles of our society

While this may be true, hasn't the killing of innocents (and murder or rape, or destruction of property) always been considered deeply immoral (outside of wars) ?

We already clamp down on extremism, and potential extremists are actively monitored using existing surveillance techniques.
Is it really that bad to go after them just a little bit more ?

Anyhow, for a well thought out response:
