I'm sure you can find many people who self-identify as patriots while also favoring policies that would allow more immigration.
I'm one of these people.

Even if you don't, you don't have to necessarily think you're better than other people because you're against immigration.
Many of these people believe that it's not our responsibility as Americans to provide for people from other countries, but rather the responsibility of those countries.
That's not the same as thinking you're better than other people.
I don't want absolutely no immigration control for people coming into the US, but I don't think I'm better than the people I'd be denying citizenship.
