&gt; Most reasonable people think groups like the KKK, the Golden Dawn, Nazis, Militant anarchist terrorists, ISIS, Al-Qaeda and any other neo-fascist group are dangerous.

I don't disagree, but on principle who gets to define what being a reasonable person is?
Stalin thought non-stalinists were dangerous, and probably a lot of Russians did too who most would consider reasonable.
Remember reasonable people actually voted Hitler into office.
