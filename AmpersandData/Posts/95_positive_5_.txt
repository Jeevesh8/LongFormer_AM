And who gets to decide what being a moderate was, and why is it tied to what the majority wants?
Todays moderates are tomorrows conservatives, and throughout history the majority has been okay with a lot of terrible shit.

Is a democracy really that stable if it needs to censor radical ideas to stop nastiness from happening?
It seems a need for censorship implies a certain degree of exposure to these ideas.
Also, stable democracies have elected terrible people too who have done terrible things.
100 years of reasonable people who likely were considered moderates lead a persecution of Indians from the Trial of Tears to Wounded Knee.
