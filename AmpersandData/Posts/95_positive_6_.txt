But hasn't most of the world moved past the age of tyrannical rulers ?
Genocide is something most of the world has moved past, and only a few extremist individuals try to advocate it.

I do agree that today's moderates are potentially tomorrow's conservatives.
However this isn't about being just a bit conservative.
It's about people that advocate death and destruction - terrorism, genocide, ethnic cleansing and murder.

Conservatives don't do this, it's extremists.

&gt; Is a democracy really that stable if it needs to censor radical ideas to stop nastiness from happening? 

There will always be evil people that bring misery to the world.
Why is it wrong to try and stop them ?
