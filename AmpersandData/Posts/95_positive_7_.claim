I challenge the assertion we have moved past it considering what's happening in the middle east
even beyond tyranny the west seems complicit in a global order that directly leads to many deaths of the worlds poor each day that they could have prevented
I don't think all these comparisons are true
they certainly aren't hard to make
And they certainly have been made throughout history.
Exactly
my point there wasn't that conservatives are terrible, but that what is considered moderate and okay changes
It isn't some objective fact about people.
The point is what people consider moderate and reasonable isn't set in stone
to adopt a zero tolerance policy cuts too deeply and may cut in the wrong direction
