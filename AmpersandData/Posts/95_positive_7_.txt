&gt; But hasn't most of the world moved past the age of tyrannical rulers ? Genocide is something most of the world has moved past, and only a few extremist individuals try to advocate it.

People thought the exact same thing before WWI.
They thought they were too civilized for what would happen in the next 50 years.
And I challenge the assertion we have moved past it considering what's happening in the middle east.
Hell, Rwanda wasn't that long ago either.
And even beyond tyranny the west seems complicit in a global order that directly leads to many deaths of the worlds poor each day that they could have prevented.

&gt; I do agree that today's moderates are potentially tomorrow's conservatives. However this isn't about being just a bit conservative. It's about people that advocate death and destruction - terrorism, genocide, ethnic cleansing and murder.

One person's terrorist is another person's freedom fighter.
One's person's genocide is another person's defense of their culture.
One person's murderer is a other's soldier.
Now, I don't think all these comparisons are true, but they certainly aren't hard to make.
And they certainly have been made throughout history.

 &gt; Conservatives don't do this, it's extremists.

Exactly, my point there wasn't that conservatives are terrible, but that what is considered moderate and okay changes.
It isn't some objective fact about people.
J. S. Mill would have been considered an extreme feminist back when he wrote, but today he's very much in the center of mainline liberal thought.
The point is what people consider moderate and reasonable isn't set in stone, and to adopt a zero tolerance policy cuts too deeply and may cut in the wrong direction (either failing to get bad people or getting good people)
