Really though.
There is an unchecked organization that spies on them 24/7 without consent.
The US has given itself license to detain and torture citizens with no trial.
The energy laws in that country allow corporations to drill where they please and, as a result, poison who they please.
American citizens have clearly been lied to in many situations.
These lies have led to events like the second gulf war.
Not to mention the completely unregulated financial system.

Honestly, none of these things have been democratically voted for, so why are Americans so deluded about this?
It's not a free, democratic society by any means.
It's clearly an oligarchy
