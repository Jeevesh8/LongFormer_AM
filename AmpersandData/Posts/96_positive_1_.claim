A democracy is not necessarily a functional, benevolent government, nor is a democracy necessarily free.
Is political power in the US held by elected officials?
Are those officials elected in free and fair democratic elections?
The answer to both of those questions is unambiguously "yes."
You can argue, perhaps successfully, that the US is a fascist, un-free state
it remains by definition a democratic one
