A democracy is not necessarily a functional, benevolent government, nor is a democracy necessarily free.
The USA was intended to be a federal republic, a republic being a form of indirect democracy.
To see if it actually *is* one (at least the "republic" part), we just need to answer a few simple questions.

Is political power in the US held by elected officials?

Are those officials elected in free and fair democratic elections?

The answer to both of those questions is unambiguously "yes." 
The domestic spying, the secret courts, the torture, the corporate favoritism, the environmental destruction, the lies, the unjustified wars, the unregulated financial system... all of those are things instituted or approved by our democratically elected officials, fully within the scope of power ceded to them by the constitution.
And we continue to vote those who do these things into office in free and fair elections, time and time again, without fail.

You can argue, perhaps successfully, that the US is a fascist, un-free state, but it remains by definition a democratic one.
