Anyone *can* run for office.
You might not get very far, but you can run.
And you don't need millions of dollars, you need to be *able to raise* millions of dollars.
In itself, I don't see a problem with that.
Raising large amounts of money requires leadership, diplomacy, organization, charisma&#8230; all traits I like to see in my elected officials.
The corruption and lack of transparency created by PACs and SuperPACs and Citizens United in general is definitely a major problem, but like some other things that have come up in this discussion, it's not an issue that makes the USA an un-democratic state.
There's no rule saying that the person who raises the most money wins the election.
The fact that most people vote for the most visible candidate on their side rather than the one that most closely represents their interests is a problem with the electorate and also a result of our winner-take-all voting system, but neither of those are in conflict with the USA being a democracy by definition.
