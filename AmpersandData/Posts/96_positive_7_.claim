The reason I think this is important is because I'm pissed off about the way things are in America
I always think that the best way to address a problem is to see it for what it is
America's problem isn't that it isn't a democracy
I think that America's problem is that it has fetishized democracy to the point where anything resulting from that system is accepted, even if it's corrupt and tyrannical
that's exactly what it's turning into
