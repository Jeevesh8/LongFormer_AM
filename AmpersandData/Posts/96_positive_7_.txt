&gt; Okay, I think you have officially Changed My View haha

Glad this has been a productive discussion.
If your view has indeed been changed, please draw your attention to "The delta (&#8710;) system" in the sidebar and award me one delta.

The reason I think this is important is because I'm pissed off about the way things are in America, as I'm sure you are, and I always think that the best way to address a problem is to see it for what it is.
America's problem isn't that it isn't a democracy; rather, I think that America's problem is that it has fetishized democracy to the point where anything resulting from that system is accepted, even if it's corrupt and tyrannical, and that's exactly what it's turning into.
No, we're probably never going to get money out of politics entirely, but corporations being able to anonymously fund entire campaigns is a major threat to healthy government, even if it isn't, strictly speaking, un-democratic.
