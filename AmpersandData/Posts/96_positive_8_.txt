A delta for you then! (I'm new, so sorry in advance if I mess it up)

Maybe I put forward the wrong view, but I think you and I more or less agree that their is something fetid in the system.
I get tired of seeing people worship at the altar of the US flag - they seem blind to what the US government is really about.
Cheers!
