I think this isn't ALWAYS true.
Some people aren't changed by others that easily.
And I think your argument applies only to boards like /b/ or /pol/.
If you go on 4chan right now to the /wg/ board (wallpapers) or the /vr/ board, almost everyone there is nice.
They are the boards to people with dedication and interests, though.
