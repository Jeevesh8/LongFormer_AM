there is very little skill involved in playing the game
Though it does this job well, I believe it is this intent that causes it to be thoroughly not fun.
While this system would work in a **quick** game between 2 to 3 people, monopoly is usually drawn out and played with 4+ players.
If Monopoly was redesigned to rely less on chance (perhaps a redesign of the board, more mechanics to tip the scales of chance perhaps with better "Chance" cards, or even removal of the pieces entirely) and to be quicker ( Add penalties for each additional player over 3 so that the success and failures of each decision weigh more heavily, for example) then the game will be much more fun and enjoyable to everyone.
