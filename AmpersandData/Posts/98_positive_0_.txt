For the sake of this thread, we'll exclude children with medically diagnosed learning disabilities; IMO the knowledge and resource base for teaching said children is probably proportionate to the percentage they make up of the overall population.

With a healthy child, income, neighborhood, peers and teachers should be filtered through a responsible parent(s).
A child who struggles in earnest or intentionally slacks off is a direct reflection of parenting.
I am curious regarding potential for more public accountability held to parents who fail to direct their child.(maybe a monetary incentive derived from public tax coffers paid to parents of children who maintain a passing grade, to be withheld if child dips below.)

I think parents are virtually 100% responsible for producing scholastically successful children.
