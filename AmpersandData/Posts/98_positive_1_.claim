An issue is there are a ton of people with "disabilities" more so than you'd think.
Thats the issue.
It doesnt make me stupid
THAT is the issue
Everyone has a mind that works in its own way
The problem isnt always bad parenting, though that can play a role,
the problem is a black and white educational system
Treating everyone the same way, other than special classes for "dumb" kids is the problem.
Learning seems hard or dumb to some kids
If a child can discuss something he or she cares about then the parents are just a plus.
