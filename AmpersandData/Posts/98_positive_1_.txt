I had parents who were extremely persistent about making sure i stayed on track.
I was only recently diagnosed with adhd a reading disability and im 20 years old.
I graduated on time but i struggled so much.
I failed a bunch of stuff and was constantly embarrassed to show my grades to other people.
I lost hope often because things felt hopeless, which lead teachers, doctors, family and other students to think i just didnt care.

An issue is there are a ton of people with "disabilities" more so than you'd think.
Thats because we teach everyone to think the same way.

Thats the issue.
Im really good at doing certain things.
For example, i can read , write, and even speak backwards pretty well.
My brain is wired differently.

I cant do the things the average person can, but i can do a lot of things that they cant.
It doesnt make me stupid, because im capable of the same things just in a different way, but my experience at school did its best to convince me that i was stupid.
THAT is the issue.
Everyone has a mind that works in its own way.

The problem isnt always bad parenting, though that can play a role, the problem is a black and white educational system.

Treating everyone the same way, other than special classes for "dumb" kids is the problem.

Learning seems hard or dumb to some kids and thats because its not tapping into their mind right.

If a child can discuss something he or she cares about then the parents are just a plus.
