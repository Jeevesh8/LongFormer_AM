&gt; I cant do the things the average person can, but i can do a lot of things that they cant. It doesnt make me stupid, because im capable of the same things just in a different way, but my experience at school did its best to convince me that i was stupid. THAT is the issue. Everyone has a mind that works in its own way.


Yes.
I think that builds my initial point.
Parents should be educated on how to identify *how* their child's mind works.
This is what I meant when I said "100%" on the parents.
You're parents would've known how to turn the way your mind worked into a successful academic career, in a perfect world.
