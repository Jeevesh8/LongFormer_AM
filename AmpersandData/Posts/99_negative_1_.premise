After all the gore I witnessed on 4chan, I'm able to jump in an accident scene and actually keep my cool while most other people around are freaking out like crazed apes, yelling and really doing nothing to help at all.
After all the freak sexualities i was exposed to in 4chan, I find it hard to judge anyone about anything they do with their bodies and partners.
It can have a bad influence with all the racism etc tho
this, you have to keep in check yourself
some people may answer to you that there is not much to be optimistic about in this world and that maybe you are delusional/uninformed to think otherwise
