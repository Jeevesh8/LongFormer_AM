 Yeah, but my point is that giving money to people that have successful children is going, ultimately, to lead to giving money to people that already have money, and withholding it from ones that don't.

Unless you make the reward high enough to overcome the *reasons* that poor parents are less involved (e.g. they don't have time because they are having to work 2 jobs just to support the children), it's not going to solve the problem.
And that's going to be very expensive.

Furthermore, there's a more fundamental *reason* that poor parents are poorer at helping their children... they're statistically dumber than richer people.
Ignorance might be the cause, of course, rather than just lack of intrinsic intelligence.

It would seem that a better approach would be to pay parents to attend training on how to be better parents, rather than rewarding the ones that have just happened to figure it out on their own.

But honestly, I think you're just being naive about actual statistical variation in native intelligence.
There's really no reason to believe that every person has exactly the same potential to succeed well in school.
A simpler explanation is that native intelligence is probably normally distributed, like almost every other trait people possess.
