CMV: Religion is not violent or not violent, its followers are.

I point out that many Christians follow the bible which has numerous examples of sexism, but in application, there are numerous branches of Christianity that are no more sexist than secular groups.
my belief is that while religion can inform the views of people, it is far more likely that religion will be used to justify actions that would have been executed any way.
I think that most Jewish people don't want to stone adulterers and most Muslims don't want to stone non believers.
Your stance relies on the assumption that religion has no influence on the actions of its followers beyond the superficial.
With this in mind, I think its safe to assume the truth is somewhere in between, with both the religion and the culture somehow influencing the unrest we see.
it obviously does
I still think the culture dominates religion to a great extent
