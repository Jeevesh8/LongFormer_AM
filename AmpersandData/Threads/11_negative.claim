CMV: I think the Paris shooting makes a good case for culture of responsible gun ownership any carrying.
I think France is in a tough spot in how to react to this.
I think it would be a shame to allow the many, who are afraid more then anything, to be swayed by xenophobic nationalists (which might have been the goal of the attack anyway).
I think this, regardless of whether the weapons used by the attackers were owned legally, makes a good case for promoting a culture of a reasonable gun ownership and carrying.
I also think this would be much better then increase in police numbers and rights
it didn't solve much
it seems to me as evidence that just having police is not enough
