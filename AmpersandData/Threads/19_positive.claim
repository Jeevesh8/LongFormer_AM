CMV: EMTs, SAR, firefighters, police, etc. should receive “military discounts”.
It seems that medical responders (even hospital staff, actually) and other emergency services do more good for society than soldiers
such discounts should be given to them.
EMS people are just as deserving of these discounts (and that many more people contribute enough to be placed in the same category),
these discounts shouldn’t be offered at all.]
There are plenty of professions that do great things for society
I don't believe I ever argued that they were.
Your premise is that these professions "do more good" than soldiers
