CMV - Mobile websites are a relic of the early mobile internet era and are inferior to actual websites when using your smartphone.
There isn't a single instance where a mobile website is preferable to a full site
it outweighs the "some people don't have smartphones" argument
"Websites should not default force mobile and have the option to go default and instead start default and allow mobile."
It's very off putting and doesn't encourage me, as op, to continue discussing my view
there are plenty of cheaper smartphones with less memory and a lesser processor which may chug a little bit on these websites.
these versions of the websites are often much more barebones and designed with a phone in mind.
the only issue with that is it's very subjective.
At least if it defaults to mobile, that 3G issue I mentioned means the website will load very quickly if you've got a good connection and let you scroll down and hit desktop right away, and then if you're on a poor connection you're not stuck waiting for the full website to load before being able to switch back to mobile.
