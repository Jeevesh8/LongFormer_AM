CMV: Otherkin are delusional and should be treated as such
Otherkin, or animalkin, the belief that their soul is an animal or something nonhuman, fit this definition
should be urged to seek psychiatric evaluation rather than joining communities of similar "kin."
We should not encourage and accept otherkin behavior, but rather encourage seeking treatment for a delusional disorder.
Don't they need locking up in padded cells too?
The difference is that Christians believing a man came down and impregnated a woman does not have a significant affect on their day-to-day lives and social interactions.
Yes it does
Yes they do!
