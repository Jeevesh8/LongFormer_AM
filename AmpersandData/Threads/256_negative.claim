CMV: Swimming is the best form of exercise
obviously a balanced exercise regimen is the best choice for health and well-being
there is no reason other than lack of availability to choose anything other than swimming
"best form of exercise" is actually meaningless
you are dismissing "lack of availability" as a reason pretty easily.
That is probably one of the biggest reasons.
fair enough
I still feel that for those who are able swimming is the best form of exercise
