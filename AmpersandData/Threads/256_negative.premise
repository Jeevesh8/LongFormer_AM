someone were forced to stick to a single exercise technique
cardio, able to be done at a variety of speeds over a variety of distances, making it suitable for a wide range of fitness levels
resistance in many muscle groups, especially when strokes in question are varied and tools such as fins or kickboards are added
low-impact, making it suitable for older people, people with recent injuries, or those with longer-term joint problems
whole-body (or at least most-of-the-body)
For one thing, I can't swim.
I can (for the most part) bob in place well enough to keep myself from drowning, but when I add any type of movement I end up with lungs full of water.
It's not from lack of trying either.
I've had lots of swimming lessons, and I just can't catch on.
