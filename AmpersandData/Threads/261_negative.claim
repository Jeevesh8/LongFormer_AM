CMV: Surplus Value Theorem is definitive proof that capitalism is an inefficient system.
waste has to be produced in order for the system to function
items that cannot be sold must still be produced and thrown away.
*No* theorem is "proof"!
it's *facts* that prove or disprove theorems.
Ultimately the proof/disproof of the efficiency/inefficiency of Capitalism/Communism must come from the comparison and evaluation of historical before and after facts
The facts definitively disprove SVT!
