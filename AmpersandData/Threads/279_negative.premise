I don't care if people post nudes, I'm just saying that this is how I feel when I see people posting nudes.
simply need because that's their personality and that they feed off of attention.
I don't understand how posting images of yourself naked, often with the understanding that others will masturbate to you (/r/gonewild for example) is not empowering but instead a form of whoring yourself out in a sense.
