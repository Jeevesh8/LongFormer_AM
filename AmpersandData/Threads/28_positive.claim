CMV The EGG came first before the chicken.
The chicken egg comes before any creature considered a chicken exist.
In terms of evolution, the question is erroneous.
The ancestral organism from which the chicken is derived never gave bith to a chicken egg.
due to the gradual process that produces what we call new species and how we define them, there was never a single egg that gave rise to the first chicken.
if scientists had enough evidence a distinction would be made.
Where ever the distinction would be made, wouldn't that make the egg first?
And if you define a species as an independently reproducing population I think both comes at the same time.
When that happens the egg becomes a chicken egg and the X becomes a chicken.
