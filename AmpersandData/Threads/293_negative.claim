CMV: If you're able, European and subscribe even loosely to European values, you should be on the Ukrainian border, driving back Russians
Feels to me as if Putin senses weakness in the Western world
His territorial pissings seems to be meant to elbow some room for himself on the geopolitical stage, in other words gaining power.
Putin is a totalitarian, oppressive, ruthless man, and allowing him to gain more power will affect all of us.
Being able doesn't imply you are going to be helpful on that front.
I count that towards 'being on the Ukrainian border, driving back Russians'
Your original post had a very different tone to it however.
