CMV: The global dominance of the abrahamic faiths is largely an accident of geography
it seems that the core of the success of the Abrahamic religions is dependent largely on the middle east's nature as both a major trade hub between Africa, Europe, and the rest of Asia
and on the fertile crescent's comparatively ancient status as a settled region
If your assertion was correct, Judiasim would be way higher than the four non Abrahamic religions above it.
I don't agree that in order for my assertion to be correct, Judaism must be comparable in terms of being widespread to Islam or Christianity.
Judiasm is a counter-example to your statement.
