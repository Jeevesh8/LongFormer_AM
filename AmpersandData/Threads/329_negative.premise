Democracies can be oppressive illiberal regimes, totalitarian systems, command-and-control socialist systems, social democracies, liberal capitalist states, oligarchies etc.

For example: according to you a democracy is defined as "a state which has strict financial regulations, outlaws fracking,
doesn't have a spy network".
