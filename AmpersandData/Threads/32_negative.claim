CMV: Eugenics isn't all that bad... And we don't even have to kill anyone for it
Intelligence is at least partially genetic
I'm against killing.
This would eventually make the human race smarter
Exceptions would be made when you accidentally have twins which causes you to go over your limit
this is really the main reason not to do it.
that this process, if not abused, if followed by the people, and if we found an increasingly accurate measure of intelligence, would be ultimately a good thing to advance the human race.
