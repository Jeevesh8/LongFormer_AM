CMV - Mobile websites are a relic of the early mobile internet era and are inferior to actual websites when using your smartphone.
There isn't a single instance where a mobile website is preferable to a full site
it outweighs the "some people don't have smartphones" argument
"Websites should not default force mobile and have the option to go default and instead start default and allow mobile."
It's very off putting and doesn't encourage me, as op, to continue discussing my view
mobile sites require less amount of data transfer to view than a desktop site
web sites can be accessed globally and not everyone has the type of network the US enjoys
