CMV: EMTs, SAR, firefighters, police, etc. should receive “military discounts”.
It seems that medical responders (even hospital staff, actually) and other emergency services do more good for society than soldiers
such discounts should be given to them.
EMS people are just as deserving of these discounts (and that many more people contribute enough to be placed in the same category),
these discounts shouldn’t be offered at all.]
Sure firefighters, EMT's, and nurses do great things for people. . . for those who have money and great insurance.
What a douchebag line.
It's not like the dispatcher chooses which calls to answer based on insurance policies.
