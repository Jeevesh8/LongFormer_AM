CMV: Any given aspect of the legal system should be short and simple enough that an average high school graduate could fully memorize it
simple enough that almost anyone could, if they were struck by the impulse to make that unusually large commitment, do so
I think the law should be simple enough that close to anybody could reasonably know the mechanics of all the laws likely to apply to them.
Ideally, it should be a relatively simple feat of memorization to learn the names of all the categories of law; the number of laws in each category; and the basic mechanics of the enforcement of that category's laws.
it should be well within the average citizen's capacity to know all the laws likely to apply to them, word-for-word or close to it.
many laws regulate things that are simply far too complex to simplify to that level
changing the US laws would not change international laws
the systems of treaties necessary to interface with other countries' economies would be complex in proportion to the complexities of those countries' economic law
reforming all the countries' economic legal systems to be simpler in compatible ways at the same time is a way bigger implausibility than reforming just one country's economic law in a way that is self-consistent.
