Like, most people don't memorize all of Romeo and Juliet.
But most people, I think, if they really wanted to, **could.**
I'm 100% on board with trashing the US constitution and starting from scratch with new documents, so appealing to the constitution is not on topic.
I think the American legal system has gotten out of hand in complexity.
By categories, I mean things like: criminal law; the tax code; any given category of regulation by profession (medical, construction, IT, and so on).
It generally takes an undergraduate college level education at minimum to understand something like international financial markets and to then effectively regulate them
Laws have to be made with a working knowledge of the system and their language will reflect that.
the actual practice of economics would become drastically simpler if the law were simpler internationally
