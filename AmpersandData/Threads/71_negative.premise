For those of you who don’t know, it’s common (at least in the US) for businesses, transit agencies, etc. to give small discounts to military veterans to thank them for their service.
As for the “They’re not risking their lives for our country.” argument, police officers do that too, and for citizens rather than the country and its interests
Some might argue that soldiers do the US a disservice rather than help
that’s [usually] the fault of their leaders and therefore not relevant to the debate
