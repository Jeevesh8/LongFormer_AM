CMV: EMTs, SAR, firefighters, police, etc. should receive “military discounts”.
It seems that medical responders (even hospital staff, actually) and other emergency services do more good for society than soldiers
such discounts should be given to them
EMS people are just as deserving of these discounts (and that many more people contribute enough to be placed in the same category)
these discounts shouldn’t be offered at all
I'd like to point out federal vs. municipal difference when it comes to location of the discount.
may point to a succinct reason why they tend to receive a blanket discount in most areas of the US.
That’s a good point
