CMV: I believe you have three choices once you discover the suffering animals endure in the meat industry...
The options are as follows
1. You don't agree with what is going on and stop supporting it.
2. You don't care about animals, so you're content with paying for them to be abused for your pleasure.
3. You don't agree with what is going on, but try to put it to the back of your mind and continue to support it.
I suspect this way of looking at it is still somewhat simplistic however
If I stop eating meat today, it won't make any difference whatsoever and won't save even a single animal's life.
The only way to make real change in industries like this is to organize and participate in a boycott on a wide-scale level
to petition the government to make regulation changes.
