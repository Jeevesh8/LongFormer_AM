I used to follow 'option number 3', but recently started 'option number 1' in an attempt to line my actions up with my values.
As in never buying meat again
even as you know that doing so will not have any impact on the meat industry whatsoever
won't make even an ounce of difference in the lives of animals?
What's the point?
I wouldn't buy ivory, dog leather or fur for the same reasons
I find meat disgusting based on what I've seen and want no part of endorsing it whether it makes any difference overall or not.
