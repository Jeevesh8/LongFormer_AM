CMV: Otherkin are delusional and should be treated as such
Otherkin, or animalkin, the belief that their soul is an animal or something nonhuman, fit this definition
should be urged to seek psychiatric evaluation rather than joining communities of similar "kin."
We should not encourage and accept otherkin behavior, but rather encourage seeking treatment for a delusional disorder.
Generally speaking, delusions themselves are arguably less relevant to whether or not a behavior is indicative of a disorder than are the social repercussions of that behavior.
While you may find the practice disingenuous or disgusting, this is not reason enough to hold the behavior as evidence of a specific disorder in and of itself
in cases where there may be genuine mental illness involved, I believe that there's enough criteria already set forth in the DSM to diagnose these conditions accurately without directly addressing this particular cultural phenomenon as some kind of mental health outlier.
You're right.
if someone is generally in a better state identifying as an otherkin, then there would be no real need to treat them, unless they started disrupting the lives of others.
