I've spent a lot of time with similar problems
how could I not know all the details and little tricks of these problems?
whether it be math or psychology or medicine
I don't hear "you're so good at biology"
Then wouldn't a complement be just an acknowledgement of the time and effort you put into something that most people see as hard or worthwhile?
they don't put the time and effort into something generally hard or worthwhile
the time and effort isn't hard or worthwhile
No only am I accepting their compliment
I'm showing some of what I truly believe.
