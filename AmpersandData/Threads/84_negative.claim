CMV: Humans are going to die out because of an economic collapse
Bill Gade presents the argument better than I do so I will just quote him.
I do realize that this is a very unhealthy idea to have whether or not that the idea is true or not, I just have not been able to beat it myself.
I do disagree with Gade a little bit.
I don't think it would kill everybody,
I probably believe this because I listen to Alex Jones too much.
Something like this will take decades or centuries and won't be applied evenly across the entire planet.
Economic bubbles historically popped in a matter of months.
I have trouble equating a financial bubble with the entire world economy.
