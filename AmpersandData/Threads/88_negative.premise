Therefore, there will always be a market for meat and other animal products
Since the majority of farms are large factory farms
this practice would be much easier to "evangelize" than a vegetarian or vegan diet.
Face it, meat is tasty (and non-factory meat is often tastier than factory-farmed meat, at least in my own anecdotal experience)
I personally don't have a problem with animals being killed humanely,
if I become vegetarian it would be about welfare
