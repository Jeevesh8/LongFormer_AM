These event reminds people that they cannot depend on protection by government.
Say if 1 out of 5 people carried a gun with them, was well trained in its use and tested in his responsibility to prevent its misuse
society upheld the value of these people as protectors, it would benefit the society more the the current state of legislature and culture of gun ownership in most of European countries
as policemen are a very homogeneous group trained to stick together and the danger of even deepening the "not one of us" (pack) mentality and escalation of "police state"
If increasing gun ownership would benefit society, would there be a point where if X number of people owned and carried a gun, there would be no shootings at all?

I dunno,they have a reputation for misuse?
Distinguish between decreasing and stopping, owning and responsibly owning, laws and culture...
