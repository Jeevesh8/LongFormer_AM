According to the theory of evolution it makes more sense that the egg preceded the chicken
Before the chicken there was a similar but different creature.
Let's call it X.
Its completely arbitrary when the X officially evolved into a chicken
at some point it does
An X, not a chicken lays the first chicken egg.
The modern domestic chicken is a hybrid of a red and grey junglefowl.
The egg produced by cross-breading the two species resulted in the first chicken.
