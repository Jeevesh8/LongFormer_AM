CMV: I believe that regularly browsing 4chan will make you into a worse person
Surrounding yourself with this will in general make you into a more pessimistic, negative and possibly depressive person.
I'm not saying that every person who browses 4chan is depressed or negative
that the majority of them are affected negatively by browsing the site
Thinking that you are unaffected by this doesn't necessarily mean you are, but instead means that you are unaware of how much it affects you.
I think this isn't ALWAYS true.
I think your argument applies only to boards like /b/ or /pol/
I think those boards are bit more niche and have less users.
I get your point
